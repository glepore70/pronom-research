Obsidium is a feature-rich professional software protection and licensing system that was designed as a cost effective and easy to implement, yet reliable and non-invasive way to protect your 32- and 64-bit Windows software applications and games from reverse engineering, unauthorized modifications ("cracking") and redistribution ("software piracy") while providing a secure and flexible licensing/registration system.

It is primarily aimed at software companies and individual developers who would like to provide feature- or time-limited evaluation versions of their software products, but also allows for the implementation of a wide range of custom licensing scenarios.

Visit the Details page for a list of key features.

A functionally limited demo version of Obsidium is available for download and may be evaluated without a time limit.
