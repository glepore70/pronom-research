Oric was the name used by UK-based Tangerine Computer Systems for a series of 6502-based home computers sold in the 1980s, primarily in Europe.

With the success of the ZX Spectrum from Sinclair Research, Tangerine's backers suggested a home computer and Tangerine formed Oric Products International Ltd to develop the Oric-1. The computer was introduced in 1982.[5] During 1983, approximately 160,000 Oric-1 computers were sold in the UK, plus another 50,000 in France (where it was the year's top-selling machine). This resulted in Oric being acquired and given funding for a successor model, the 1984 Oric Atmos.

Oric was bought by Eureka, which produced the less successful Oric Telestrat (1986). Oric was dissolved the year the Telestrat was released. Eastern European clones of Oric machines were produced into the 1990s.

The DSK file format
The de-facto standard for Oric disk images is the DSK format. Unfortunately this extension covers two different file formats:

The older format, which stores only the high level structure of a disk â€” tracks and sectors. This is adequate for storing standard disks generated by the normal Oric disk operating systems, but cannot be used to archive disks with special formatting or protections. These disks are identified by the ORICDISK signature at the start of the file.
The newer format, which uses a byte-aligned representation of the data bits of a track so that a floppy disk controller can identify the various locations on a floppy while it is spinning: headers, synchronisation sequences, checksums, gaps, etc. This permits a greater range of formats to be represented, including simpler protection mechanisms. These disks are identified by the MFM_DISK signature at the start of the file.

The new (MFM_DISK) format
All the data is stored in little endian format. In the documentation below, data is indicated in hexadecimal and counts in decimal.

Header
New DSK files start with a 256-byte header:

the 8-byte signature: MFM_DISK;
