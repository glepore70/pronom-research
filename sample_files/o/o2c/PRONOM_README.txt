The o2c technology enables you to present three dimensional objects in a compact format at a very high speed. You can view detailed 3D objects in the o2c player detailed from all angles, animate elements for presentation purposes and simulate complex movements. Even use existing CAD data as the basis for your o2c objects.

Architects can save their design as an o2c object and send the file as an email attachment to their client. Customers can then use the free o2c player to view the file, helping design discussions and consultations without the customer needing to use and understand CAD software.
