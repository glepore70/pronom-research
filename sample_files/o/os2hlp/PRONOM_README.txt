INF and HLP are two variants of a help file format associated with OS/2's "Information Presentation Facility", and used by some OS/2 applications. Files can be viewed with an OS/2 app named VIEW.EXE.

Files begin with ASCII "HS", followed (usually?) by "P".

The next byte is (usually?) 0x01 for INF, or 0x10 for HLP.
