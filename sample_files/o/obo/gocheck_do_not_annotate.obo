def: "A signaling process that controls cell cycle progression by monitoring the integrity of specific cell cycle events. A cell cycle checkpoint begins with detection of deficiencies or defects and ends with signal transduction." [GOC:mtg_cell_cycle]
comment: This term should not be used in direct manual annotation as it should always be possible to minimally designate mitotic or meiotic checkpoint, and usually to additionally specify the checkpoint (i.e mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint, mitotic DNA damage checkpoint etc). Note also that the effector processes are not part of the checkpoint but are positively regulated by the checkpoint signaling and should not be annotated here.

comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation.

comment: Some transporters, such as certain members of the SLC family, are referred to as 'carriers'; however GO uses carrier with a different meaning: a carrier binds to and transports the substance (see GO:0140104 molecular carrier activity), whereas a transporter forms some pore that allows the passing of molecules.

Depending on external conditions, quiescence may persist until cell death or cells may resume cell growth and division.

If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation is 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase. To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

comment: This term should not be used for direct annotation. If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation should be to 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase (e.g. mitotic DNA replication for mitotic S-phase). To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).
