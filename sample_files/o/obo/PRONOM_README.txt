DRAFT

OBO format is the text file format used by OBO-Edit, the open source, platform-independent application for viewing and editing ontologies.

This document is intended as a companion guide to the OBO-Format, in the style of the OBO 1.2 file format guide. It is not intended as a formal specification of syntax or semantics - this is available as a seperate document, the OBO Format Syntax and Semantics available at http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/oboformat/spec.html document. The formal specification is normative, this document is only a guide.

The official website for OBO Format documentation and software is http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/oboformat
