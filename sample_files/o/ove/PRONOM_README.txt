Overture is a music notation (scorewriter) program for Windows and Macintosh platforms, published and developed by Sonic Scores.[3] While Overture is primarily a scorewriter program, it also allows editing the score's MIDI audio playback data in the manner of sequencer and digital audio workstation (DAW) software.

To facilitate film scoring, Overture has the ability to play film video footage synchronized to the score playback, and to insert precise time markers into the score.[4]

Overture was the first scorewriter to feature full Virtual Studio Technology (VST) hosting,[5] allowing audio playback of the score with virtual instruments, controlled by the program's mixing-desk style interface.[6]
