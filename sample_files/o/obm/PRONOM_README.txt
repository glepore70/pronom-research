A text editor intended for programmers developed by the company RimStar Technology Inc.. Available for OS/2 and 32 bit versions of MS Windows it features some some decidedly BRIEF like features, but that needs not come as a surprise as author Brian L. Smith was one of the main programmers of BRIEF. The product was delivered in two distinct versions, Standard and Professional.
