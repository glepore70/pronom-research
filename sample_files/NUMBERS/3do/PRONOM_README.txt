Grim Fandango is a 1998 adventure game directed by Tim Schafer and developed and published by LucasArts for Microsoft Windows. It is the first adventure game by LucasArts to use 3D computer graphics overlaid on pre-rendered static backgrounds. As with other LucasArts adventure games, the player must converse with characters and examine, collect, and use objects to solve puzzles.

Grim Fandango is set in the Land of the Dead, through which recently departed souls, represented as calaca-like figures, travel before they reach their final destination. The story follows travel agent Manuel "Manny" Calavera as he attempts to save new arrival Mercedes "Meche" Colomar, a virtuous soul, on her journey. The game combines elements of the Aztec afterlife with film noir style, with influences including The Maltese Falcon, On the Waterfront and Casablanca.

Grim Fandango received praise for its art design and direction. It was selected for several awards and is often listed as one of the greatest video games of all time. However, it was a commercial failure and contributed towards LucasArts' decision to end adventure game development and the decline of the adventure game genre.

In 2014, with help from Sony, Schafer's studio Double Fine Productions acquired the Grim Fandango license following Disney's acquisition and closure of LucasArts as a video game developer the previous year. In June 2014, Double Fine announced a remastered version of the game, featuring improved character graphics, controls (including point and click), an orchestrated score, and directors' commentary. It was released for Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, OS X, and Linux in January 2015, for Android and iOS in May 2015, for Nintendo Switch in November 2018, and for Xbox One in October 2020.

I have started to put together notes on the format of the models in the full version of Grim Fandango. It has some holes however and any suggestions would be welcome etc.

I probably won't get a chance to look at this further for a bit anyway.

I have a bit of code that converts things to a text format like Jedi Knight and the grim demo however its not very useful as there are unknown bytes that are variable.

Anyway have a look over here (http://users.bigpond.net.au/tgray2/grim-3do.txt) if this kind of thing interests you.

They are in 3do format - there are 2 versions of the format - textual and binary (compiled). The demo uses the textual one, the full game binary. Its the same format used in some of the star wars games (jedi knight?) I cant remember which.

 

There are a few viewers floating around, but I dont think they support the binary 3do format. If you're still interested I can have a dig around my hard drive, I think I've got a few unfinished Grim model viewers by various people somewhere.
