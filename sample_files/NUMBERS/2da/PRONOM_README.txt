Infinity Engine

The Infinity Engine is a game engine which allows the creation of isometric role-playing video games. It was originally developed by BioWare for a prototype RTS game codenamed Battleground Infinity, which was ultimately re-engineered to become the first installment of the Baldur's Gate series. BioWare used it again in the subsequent installments of the series, but also licensed the engine to Interplay's Black Isle Studios.

The Infinity Engine features pausable realtime gameplay. The engine uses a three quarters perspective with pre-rendered 2D backgrounds and sprite-based characters. Although graphically 2D for the most part, Baldur's Gate II added the use of OpenGL to accelerate drawing. Designed for six-character party-based adventuring by default, the Infinity Engine was the spiritual successor to the Gold Box Engine â€¯[citation needed] and provided the basis for five Dungeons & Dragons licensed role-playing video games plus additional expansion packs and a number of fanmade total conversion RPGs. It was succeeded by BioWare's Aurora Engine.

General Description
2DA ("2-Dimensional Array") files contain a two-dimensional array of data. They are used to hold information in tables, often relating to the game rules, e.g. THAC0 progression.

Detailed Description
2DA files are generally plain text files, unless the first two bytes are 0xff, in which case the file is encrypted. Values in 2da files are white space separated, as a result values cannot contain spaces.

2DA files should always contain at least four rows;
The first row contains the file signature, "2DA V1.0", which may be preceeded by white space.
