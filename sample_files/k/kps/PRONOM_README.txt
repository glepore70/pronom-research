IBM KIPS bitmap (KPS) is an obscure image file format. It supports paletted images with 8 bits/pixel.

The palette is stored in a separate file, and there are two possible formats for the palette file: .pal and .kpl.

Identification
KPS files begin with ASCII signature "DFIMAG00".

.kpl files also use this signature. .pal files have no signature.
