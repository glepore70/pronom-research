Format details
KQP format is an incompatible extension of BMP.

A KQP file contains embedded JPEG data, but it lacks the critical DQT and DHT segments, so it can't just be extracted as a standard JPEG file.

Identification
Known files start with bytes 42 4d 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00, and have 4a 50 45 47 ("JPEG") at offset 30.

They also apparently have 44 00 00 00 at offset 14, indicating a BMP "INFOHEADER" size of 68. This is distinctive, but hasn't been confirmed to be true for all KQP files.
