KFM files mostly belong to GameBryo by Gamebase. KFM files contain 3D models for video games created using Gamebryo engine, a cross-platform utility for game development. The KFM file usually consists of 3D characters, character motion data, geometry model data, texture-maps, as well as weapons related to each character. When generated from the standalone version of Gamebryo, a KFM file plays the role of a receptacle for storing the 3D animation in several KF (3D animation) files related to each game character.
