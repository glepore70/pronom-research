Kyma — a hardware & software environment for creative sound design, live performance, and scientific exploration.

The most powerful sound design workstation on the planet — that’s what Electronic Musician magazine called the Kyma sound design environment. Future Music called it the Holy Grail of sound design. Kyma’s effectiveness arises from its unique set of algorithms, the ease with which you can create endless combinations of those algorithms, and the unprecedented degree of real-time responsive control over the sound parameters.

You’ve already heard the sounds of Kyma in films like WALL•E, The Dark Knight, Master and Commander, Finding Nemo and in games like World of Warcraft, Quake II, Mirror’s Edge, Dark Messiah, and Mage Knight. And you’ve heard the interactive musical sounds of Kyma both on albums and in live sets by legendary musicians and producers like John Paul Jones, A.R. Rahman, Amon Tobin, Stanley Cowell, Rich Costey, Cristian Vogel, and many more.
