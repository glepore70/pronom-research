About the key file
A key file is a file with the .key extension that you receive from Kaspersky after purchasing Kaspersky Endpoint Security. The purpose of a key file is to add a license key that activates the application.

You do not need to connect to Kaspersky activation servers in order to activate the application with a key file.

You can recover a key file if it has been accidentally deleted. You may need a key file to register a Kaspersky CompanyAccount, for example.

To recover a key file, do one of the following:

Contact the license seller.
Obtain a key file on the Kaspersky website based on your existing activation code.
When the application is activated using a key file, an active key is added. A reserve license key can be added only by using a key file and cannot be added using an activation code.
