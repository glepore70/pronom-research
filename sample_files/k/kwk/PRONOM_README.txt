KwikDraw
Extension(s)	.kwk
Released	1992
KwikDraw is a vector graphics editor for Windows, developed by Paul Schimpf. It has a native .kwk file format.

Versions 1.x-2.x are for Windows 3.x.

Version 3.0 was a significant rewrite, and the .kwk format was completely changed. The 3.x versions possibly only work on 32-bit Windows, even though they are Windows 3.x programs (?!).

Identification
KWK v1.x-v2.x files start with an ASCII identification string that begins "KwikDraw". The full string is version-specific; an example is "KwikDraw v1.4, (c)1991-93".

v3.x: (TODO)
