X.Org Server is the free and open-source implementation of the X Window System display server stewarded by the X.Org Foundation.

Implementations of the client side of the protocol are available e.g. in the form of Xlib and XCB.

The services with which the X.Org Foundation supports X Server include the packaging of the releases; certification (for a fee); evaluation of improvements to the code; developing the web site, and handling the distribution of monetary donations.[citation needed] The releases are coded, documented, and packaged by global developers.[clarification needed]
