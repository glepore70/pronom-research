Sampler
We redesigned and improved our most popular plug-in — the EXS24 Sampler — and renamed it Sampler. The new single-window design makes it easier to create and edit sampler instruments while remaining backward compatible with all EXS24 files. An expanded synthesis section with sound-shaping controls brings more depth and dynamics to your instruments — it features twin filters with parallel and serial routings, and five filters modeled after both analog and modern synths. An extendable modulation section allows you to add more sources and destinations as needed. And the reimagined mapping editor adds powerful, time-saving features that speed the creation of complex instruments — including editing commands for automatic mapping, automatic loop finding, and analyzing and splitting samples into zones. Use the zone waveform editor to make precise edits to sample start/end and loop ranges with an option to snap to transients or zero crossings. And save hours of tedious editing with new drag-and-drop hot zones.

EXS files are used by EXS24, a sampler library that comes included with Logic Pro X. The library contains a large collection of samples such as strings, brass, synth textures, and pianos. EXS24 can be used to arrange sounds you recorded yourself or that were already recorded to be played back from a MIDI track within Logic or from your MIDI keyboard.

EXS files are located in the "Sampler Instruments" and the "EXS Factory Samples" folders in the "Logic" folder on your hard drive. A "Samples" folder is also located in the "Logic" folder and it contains audio files, such as .WAV or .AIF files, that are referenced by Logic when playing the associated EXS file. You can add EXS instruments to these folders, which will then appear in the instruments menu in Logic. If Logic is open when you add the instrument you need to refresh the menu in order for the instrument to appear.
