Signum! (Latin for characters! [1] ), programmed by Franz Schmerbeck, was one of the first fully graphics-based word processors in 1986 . It was developed for the Atari ST with its graphical user interface TOS when MS-DOS was still controlled purely by commands. The last version released is Signum! 4.4 Update 1.
