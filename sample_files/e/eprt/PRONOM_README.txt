Brief overview of SolidWorks eDrawings
SolidWorks eDrawings is a powerful and user-friendly tool that enables seamless design collaboration between engineers, designers, and other stakeholders in the product development process. It serves as a bridge for communication by allowing users to view, interpret, and share 2D and 3D CAD models and drawings without the need for the original design software.

eDrawings simplifies the process of sharing complex designs by generating lightweight, easily shareable files that maintain the visual and geometrical accuracy of the original model. With features like built-in measurement tools, mark-ups, and cross-platform compatibility, eDrawings facilitates efficient collaboration and accelerates design reviews, ultimately reducing the time to market for new products.

eDrawings file formats
1. eDrawings file format (.eprt, .easm, .edrw)
eDrawings files are specifically designed for sharing and viewing 2D drawings and 3D CAD models, making them an essential tool for collaboration in the engineering and design process. The eDrawings file format comes in three distinct extensions, each catering to a different aspect of design:

.eprt (eDrawings Part): This file format is used for storing individual 3D part models created in SolidWorks or other supported CAD software. The .eprt files retain the geometrical and visual accuracy of the original part while maintaining a smaller file size for easier sharing.
