EPSDisk is a simple yet powerful tool. With it you can make sample disks on you PC that are readable in the Ensoniq TS, ASR, and EPS keyboards and rack mount units. It is a command line tool, which means it runs from a DOS prompt and responds to text commands.

The program can be awkward and difficult to figure out at first - and I get many, many, many emails from people concerning the software. It got to the point were I had to post a somewhat less than polite message on the site stating that I would no longer respond to emails concerning the software.

It looks as if the software was written by Michael Chen while he attended college. It was written for free and is no longer maintained or supported.

I have decided to provide an online tutorial to assist in getting the novice user up and running with this software, so that they can get onto making music instead of messing about with software.

Let's be clear though, this tutorial is a COMPLETE knowledge dump of ALL that I know about how to use this software. This is it. There is no more. If your question isn't answered here, I don't have the answer, so please don't ask me. I did not write this software, I make no money from this software, I DO NOT support this software. I do provide a site to support the TS series keyboards from Ensoniq. And this is an extremely useful tool for those keyboards.

NOTE: For those who are computer savvy, this tutorial may seem somewhat rudimentary. It is geared towards a general non-technical audience, because that is the type of people I am constantly receiving emails from regarding the use of this software. This statement is not to make any derogatory or negative comments about these people, merely as to provide a baseline for the level on which this tutorial is presented.


File Types
For samples EPSDisk is the best. It's deceptively powerful. Once you get a hang of it, it's a breeze to use. There are many different file formats and it can get confusing so here are the basics:

Individual Files
The files types listed below represent a single sound/sample/instrument. You can write multiple files of these types to a single disk (depending on the sizes of the files).
