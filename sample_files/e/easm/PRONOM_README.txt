EASM is a file extension for an eDrawing assembly file used by SolidWorks.

EASM files are used to exchange 2D and 3D computer-aided design (CAD) drawings via email. EASM files contain compressed XML data, based upon the HOOPS file format created by TechSoft America. EASM files can be opened by eDrawings software, free software created by Solidworks.
