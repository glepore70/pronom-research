latexdraw â€“ CAD oriented drawing program
An X-Windows based CAD orientated drawing program which generates LATEX output using latexdraw.sty, based on pstricks. The picture may be generated as complete LATEX-source or as a picture-environment to be included in other documents. You must translate the dvi-file generated by LATEX to a PostScript-file using dvips before you can view or print the document.
