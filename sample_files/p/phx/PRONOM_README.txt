I'M GETTING AN ERROR IN SIEGFRIED WHEN I TRY TO CREATE A SIGNATURE WITH PHX1 AND PHX2 IN THE SAME SIGNATURE. THE SIGNATURE SHOULD BE (7068617365785F7061746368|2320706861736578207061746368) ANCHORED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FILE, BUT ROY GIVES AN ERROR. I THINK IT'S A BUG IN ROY.


PHASEX is an experimental MIDI softsynth for Linux/ALSA/JACK with a
synth engine built around flexible phase modulation and flexible
oscillator/LFO sources.  Modulations include AM, FM, offset PM, and
wave select.  PHASEX comes equipped with multiple filter types and
modes, a stereo crossover delay and chorus with phaser, ADSR envelopes
for both amplifier and filter, realtime audio input processing
capabilities, and more.  Inspirations come from a variety of analog
and early digital MIDI synthesizers from the '80s and '90s.
