PUT is a shareware archiver/compressor for DOS that produces files with the suffix ".put" (".PUT", using proper DOS naming conventions). The decompressor is called GET. PUT was made by a company called "MicroFox", which seems to have consisted of a single person, Jim Haas.[1]

Version 1.00 was released in 1993, but claims a copyright date of "1990-1993", so maybe it wasn't the first release.

PUT files with an .INS extension are treated specially by the "INSTALL" program that is used by, and distributed with, some versions of PUT/GET.
