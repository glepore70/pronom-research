Nord keyboards
In 1995, Clavia released the Nord Lead. Called "a magic piece of electronics" by Sound on Sound[4] it popularized the virtual analog type of synthesis. In 1997 the Nord Lead 2 was released, with many improvements, including increasing polyphony from 4 to 16 notes.[5] The Nord Lead 3 was released in 2001, with a reworked sound engine, better D/A converters and monophonic aftertouch. The most striking aspect of the Nord Lead 3 was that all the sound editing knobs had been replaced with infinite rotary knobs, where the value of the parameter was indicated by a LED 'collar' around the knob.[6] The rotary knobs, LED collars and keyboard with aftertouch made the Nord Lead 3 an "absolute delight"[7] but because of its higher price, the Nord Lead 2 remained in demand. And as some of the parts of the Nord Lead 3 were getting harder to source, Clavia released an updated version of the Nord Lead 2, called the Nord Lead 2x, with faster processors, better D/A converters and an upgraded polyphony to 20 voices.[7] The Nord Lead 3 was discontinued in 2007, but the Nord Lead 2x remains in production.[3]

In 1997 Clavia released the Nord Modular, a virtual analog modular synthesizer.[3] Called a "landmark in synthesis"[8] it allowed you to essentially build your own virtual analog synthesizer. It too was later upgraded with the 2004 release of the Nord Modular G2, that gave it the same endless rotary knobs as the Nord Lead 3 and a larger keyboard with aftertouch.[9]

PATCHES made on the G2 can be stored in the internal memory banks of the synth and/or saved on the
computer as a Patch-file. Patch-files can be exchanged with other G2 owners, e.g. by storing them on a
floppy disk or sending them over the Internet through email. Patch-files have the file-extension *.PCH2.
