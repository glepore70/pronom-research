The starting point for every design created in Altium Designer is a project. An Altium Designer project collects together a set of design documents whose output ultimately defines a single implementation of what you intend to create. For example, the schematics and PCB in a PCB project include the file set required to manufacture a printed circuit board. In contrast, the logical schematic and physical assembly files in a multi-board project output the file set to manufacture and assemble a complete product with multiple connected PCBs.

The set of design documents that make up a project can be brought together from any accessible source, local to the machine or otherwise, and are related together by the project as a unified design. Changes made to an individual project document are synchronized with the other design documents when the project is automatically compiled through dynamic compilation, compiled, allowing the changes to be propagated between design domains – for example, between documents in the Schematic and PCB domains.

PCB Project (*.PrjPcb) – The set of design documents required to manufacture a printed circuit board.
