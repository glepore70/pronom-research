Lode Runner is a 2D puzzle-platform game, developed by Douglas E. Smith and published by Broderbund in 1983. Its game-play mechanics are the same as in Space Panic from 1980. The player controls a character who must collect all the gold pieces in a level and get to the end while being chased by a number of enemies. It is one of the first games to include a level editor.

After the original game, a number of remakes, spin-offs and sequels were published in the Lode Runner series for different computers and consoles, and by different developers and publishers. Tozai Games holds the copyright and trademark rights.[6][7]
