Printer Job Language (PJL) was developed by Hewlett-Packard to
provide a method for switching printer languages at the job level, and
for status readback between the printer and the host computer. PJL
offers application programs an efficient way to remotely control
Hewlett-Packard printers. Using PJL, developers can provide
applications with the ability to programmatically switch printer
languages, monitor printer status, request the printer model and
configuration, change control panel default settings, modify control
panel messages, and more.
