ProTrekkr (formerly known as NoiseTrekker by Juan Antonio Arguelles Rius aka Arguru) is
a tracker program combining a software synthesizer together with a traditional samples
tracker which can be used to create electronic music (like psytrance, trance goa,
hard acid, IDM, chip, techno, etc.) for small sized intros, demos or games.

Currently the tracker is available on Windows, Linux, Amiga OS4, AROS and Mac OSX.
