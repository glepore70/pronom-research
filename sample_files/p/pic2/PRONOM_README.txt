Psion PIC (also known as Psion Series 3 bitmap or EPOC PIC) is a raster image file format associated with Psion's EPOC operating system, and used mainly on Psion PDA devices.

A Psion PIC file contains one or more bi-level bitmaps. Sometimes, two bitmaps need to be combined to make a 4-tone grayscale image. It's not clear whether it's possible to reliably determine which bitmaps should be combined.
