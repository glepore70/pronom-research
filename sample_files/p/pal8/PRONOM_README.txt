NeoPaint is a raster graphics editor for Windows and MS-DOS. It supports several file formats including JPEG, GIF, BMP, PNG, and TIFF.[12] The developer, NeoSoft, advertises NeoPaint as being simple enough for use by children while remaining powerful enough for the purposes of advanced image editing.[citation needed]

On September 1, 2018 NeoPaint was rebranded as PixelNEO becoming one of the VisualNEO software products.
