gettext — Message Catalogs
Purpose:	Message catalog API for internationalization.
The gettext module provides a pure-Python implementation compatible with the GNU gettext library for message translation and catalog management. The tools available with the Python source distribution enable you to extract messages from a set of source files, build a message catalog containing translations, and use that message catalog to display an appropriate message for the user at runtime.

Message catalogs can be used to provide internationalized interfaces for a program, showing messages in a language appropriate to the user. They can also be used for other message customizations, including “skinning” an interface for different wrappers or partners.
