PhotoStyler’s printing controls are generally strong and
easy to use. The Print utility lets you adjust image size
quickly, and you can add a title or printer’s marks to the
print. You can also access PhotoStyler’s other printing
controls to adjust screen frequency and angle, output
range, and even dot gain for each color channel.

PhotoStyler supports 17 color-matching systems, in-
cluding Munsell, Pantone, and Trumatch palettes.

The program gets high marks for ease of use, thanks to
its reliance on the Kodak Precision Color Management
System. This system uses “precision transform” files to
adjust colors for consistent handling among the moni-
tors, video cards, scanners, and printers you're using.
The precision transform files contain most of the pre-
press settings that are appropriate for the output device,
and they adjust the monitor to more faithfully repre-
sent what will be printed. There’s a potential trapdoor in
this system, however. For the color management sys-
tem to work optimally, you have to have precision trans-
form files written specifically for your hardware. Photo-
Styler ships with 29 transform files: two for generic
monitors, 16 for input devices, and 11 for printers.

If there isn’t a transform file for your equipment,
you're up a creek, because PhotoStyler doesn’t include
manual controls for adjusting inking limits, trapping col-
ors, or doing most of the other high-end adjustments
supported by a program such as Photoshop.

The program also provides an easy-to-
use calibration utility to adjust your mon-
itor gamma for more accurate represen-
tation of colors. But when it comes to en-
suring color accuracy, PhotoStyler relies
largely on the Kodak Precision Color
Management System, which uses “preci-
sion transform” files to adjust colors de-
pending upon your hardware — moni-
tors, video cards, scanners, and printers.

The precision transform (PT) files con-
tain all the settings for factors — such as
inking limits and undercolor removal —
that are most appropriate for your output
device, and they adjust the display de-
vices to more accurately represent what
will eventually be printed.

There are, however, two catches in the
system. The first snag is that PhotoStyler
does not include manual controls for ad-
justing inking limits, trapping colors, or
doing most of the other high-end printing
adjustments supported by a program
such as Photoshop.

Secondly, the ultimate value of this sys-
tem depends in large part on the avail-
ability of PT files for your hardware. And
no one can say with certainty how broad
a range of hardware the Kodak system
will ultimately support. As it is, only 14
transform files for input and output de-
vices — including only two generic mon-
itor files — are shipped with the program.

Assuming you have the appropriate
transform file, printing is easy. Photo-
Styler’s well-designed print utility lets
you adjust image size quickly and easily.
You can also quickly access other print
controls to adjust such options as screen
frequency and angle, output range, and
