.ptm files are modules produced by Poly Tracker. As Poly Tracker was intended by the creator (Lone Ranger of AcmE) to be a better version of ScreamTracker, the PTM format shares many similarities with the S3M format used by ScreamTracker.

There have been around a dozen versions of the PTM format, including customized test versions.
