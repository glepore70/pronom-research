This brief guide will show you how to apply patches to images (mostly image files) using PPF files that have been distributed for them. PPF files are basically patches that contain changes to be made to ISO files and other types of images. PPF originally stood for PlayStation Patch Format. A PPF file might be distributed to fix a very large ISO image, such as a 4GB DVD image, instead of re-distributing the entire image fixed again. This method can save a lot of bandwidth, time and patience.

Introduction & Requirements

	Software you must download and install
	 PPF-O-Matic
 Required: In order to use a PPF file you need to download PPF-O-Matic. It comes in a ZIP file that can be opened as a folder in Windows. Run ppf-o-matic3.exe. Download!

Once you have downloaded PPF-O-Matic you should unzip it. This can be simply done by opening the ZIP file in Windows as a folder (XP and above) and literally just dragging the contents out into a normal Windows folder, or alternatively you can extract it using WinRAR or a similar tool.

Some PPF information

When is applying a PPF file necessary? It depends on the content really. Some very large images, particularly games (like console games) can be distributed online and afterwards can be found to have slight corruption problems. In order to avoid forcing everyone to download/upload gigabytes of data again, a PPF file is constructed that contains only the changes for the image file (usually an ISO file) and nothing else. You need a tool capable of applying these changed to use a PPF file, such as PPF-O-Matic.
