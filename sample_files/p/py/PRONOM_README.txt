9.5 .RData files
The best way to store objects from R is with .RData files. .RData files are specific to R and can store as many objects as youâ€™d like within a single file. Think about that. If you are conducting an analysis with 10 different dataframes and 5 hypothesis tests, you can save all of those objects in a single file called ExperimentResults.RData.
