Corel Painter is a raster-based digital art application created to simulate as accurately as possible the appearance and behavior of traditional media associated with drawing, painting, and printmaking. It is intended to be used in real-time by professional digital artists as a functional creative tool.

Painter and Photoshop have many similarities, such as layered editing. The two products have developed as contemporaries, introducing innovations that are now considered standard in bitmap image editing software. For example, "Floaters" were released with Painter 2.5, around the time that Photoshop released "composite elements". Over time, Painter's user interface(UI) has been transformed to match Photoshop's UI.[citation needed]

Painter was initially developed[when?] for the Macintosh system by Mark Zimmer and Tom Hedges, founders of the Fractal Design Corporation. Zimmer and Hedges had previously developed ImageStudio and ColorStudio, both image-editing applications, for Letraset. John Derry joined Zimmer and Hedges during the release cycle of Painter 1.2. Derry had gained previous paint software expertise at Time Arts, a developer of the early desktop-based paint applications Lumena and Oasis. Fractal Design later merged with RayDream, then with MetaTools to become MetaCreations. Metacreations sold off[when?] all their creative interests and Painter was acquired by Corel Corporation where it was temporarily rebranded "Procreate" Painter during its transition into the Corel Suite of graphic applications. Painter is now wholly owned and marketed by Corel.

The Painter 3 interface was a radical departure from its predecessors, showing the organizational influence of John Derry. Toolbox buttons were now sculpted like the keys of a retro typewriter. The palettes are now gray-backed and the icons are much smaller. The numerous brush icons are now located in a drawer-like structure that can be opened up and closed. We first started toying with drawer-based interfaces in Dabbler. Each of the palettes has 5 graphically-represented sections. Friskets have been renamed to Paths, at the request of Steve Guttman. Our implementation of Layers, initially called Floaters, was debuted in Painter 3 as well. The Nozzle section in the Brush Controls helped the user choose the kind of images that are used with the image hose. With Painter 3, each action you did is now recorded in a script, so it can be played back, even at different resolutions. Color Sets, Gradations, and Weavings have been added. I added multiple undo as well. Painter 3 (including version 3.1) was clearly the single largest change to Painter yet.

An important UI feature was the ability to tear off art materials, like the color palette or the paper palette. Yet they were also nicely organized. This tear-off feature worked with any palette that contained icons.

Oh, and you could make a drop shadow for a floater with the push of a button.
