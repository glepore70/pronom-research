PNF file
A precompiled INF File. Windows creates a PNF file for each INF file to facilitate efficient processing. A PNF file includes information about the content of the original INF file, as well as the name of the INF file and other file attributes. Setup uses the PNF file instead of the original INF file. If a PNF file does not exist, Setup generates one for the INF file. For vendor-supplied INF files, the information contained in a PNF file also includes the location of the original INF file.
