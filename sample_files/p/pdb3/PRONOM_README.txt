Palm Database ImageViewer format is a type of Palm OS Database file. It contains a bitmap image, and is associated with the Image Viewer III application.

It is also known as FireViewer format, and maybe also TinyViewer format.

It supports at least grayscale images with 2, 4, or 16 gray shades. Images may be uncompressed, or use RLE compression.
