c) The Newton 'File System'
The Newton does not have a file system per se. It has a shallow database system. The newton considers its internal storage, and each inserted card, as a separate "store" (a volume). On any store may be placed either read/write "soups" (databases), or read-only objects called "packages".

Packages are roughly equivalent to application programs, though they may also be storage areas or plug-ins. They consist of bundles of "parts". A "part" might be a chunk of executable computer code, a set of large binary objects, a read-only embedded soup,etc. Packages can be stored in compressed or uncompressed format on the Newton. They are always uncompressed on desktop computers.
