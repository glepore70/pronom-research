General information
-------------------

As an utility for CP/M, PMARC/PMEXT doesn't allow the use of directories on
the command line, only drives. To use directories, use the DOS SUBST command
to create fake drives to work on with PMARC/PMEXT.

PMARC.COM
---------

This utility creates LZH-like archives with the extension .PMA. It compresses
as effectively as the MSDOS utility LHA, but is not completely compatible (you
can read the directory with LHA, but you can't extract files from
the archive). Just type PMARC at the prompt to see a list of options.
