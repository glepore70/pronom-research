imageiio.pe3, imaginfo.pe3, imageiio.pe4, and imaginfo.pe4 are the names of files that are auto-generated by some graphics applications from Ulead Systems. A pair of PE3 files, or of PE4 files, generally appears together. They presumably contain a thumbnail cache, and other indexing information.

Applications reported to create such files include iPhoto Plus, PhotoImpact, and Photo Explorer.
