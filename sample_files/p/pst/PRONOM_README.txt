Iomega’s Buz Multimedia Producer lets you capture and output full-screen video on a Power Mac G3 at up to 30 frames per second (fps). At $299, it packs a lot of buzz for the buck. But like any other video-editing system, it’s a complex beast that needs tweaking to deliver the best results, and its sketchy documentation does little to help.

Once you get up to speed, though, you find a remarkably capable video-capture system. The Buz uses Zoran’s Motion JPEG compression and digitizing chips to support capture sizes of up to 720 by 480 pixels and rates of up to 30 frames and 60 fields per second. In English: you can use the Buz to capture and output full-screen, full-motion video.
