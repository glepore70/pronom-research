pepXML Is an open data format developed at the SPC/Institute for Systems biology for the storage, exchange, and processing of peptide sequence assignments of MS/MS scans. pepXML is intended to provide a common data output format for many different MS/MS search engines and subsequent peptide-level analyses. Several search engines already have native support for outputting pepXML and converters are available to transform output files to pepXML.
