Pack-Ice (also called Ice Packer or ICE!) is a file compression program, and associated file format, used on Atari ST computers. It was developed by someone calling himself "Axe of Delight", who later changed his handle to "Axe of Superior".

There are several different versions of the format, and it's not clear how compatible they are.
