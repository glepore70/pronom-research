NoteWorthy Composer (NWC) is a proprietary scorewriter application made by NoteWorthy Software. It is a graphical score editor for Microsoft Windows computers (from Windows 95 to Windows 10), and also works on PCs under Linux with Wine. Version 1 of NWC was released in October 1994, and Version 2 in September 2008.[1][2]

NWC is intended for the creation of sheet music, but it can also import and export MIDI and Karaoke files and can export graphical WMFs. The user interface works either from the keyboard or the mouse. Visual results are immediate, and audible results can be heard at any time. Notes can also be entered by playing on a MIDI device, when configured. In version 2, the notes can be heard as they are entered.[1] Lyrics are entered as a single block of text which automatically positions itself on notes according to syllabic and slur rules, as opposed to being entered per-note as is standard for Sibelius, Finale, or MuseScore.

The binary NWC file format is undocumented and facilities to convert it into more popular formats are less limited. There are, however, a couple of open source libraries that can parse and convert this file format.[3][4] Version 2 of NWC introduced a textual representation of the file format called NWCTXT. This allowed easier conversion to many other formats, including LilyPond.[5]
