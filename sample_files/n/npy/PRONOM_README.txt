A simple format for saving numpy arrays to disk with the full information about them.

The .npy format is the standard binary file format in NumPy for persisting a single arbitrary NumPy array on disk. The format stores all of the shape and dtype information necessary to reconstruct the array correctly even on another machine with a different architecture. The format is designed to be as simple as possible while achieving its limited goals.
