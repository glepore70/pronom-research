The .NES file format (file name suffix .nes) is the de facto standard for distribution of NES binary programs, with use even in licensed emulators such as commercialized PocketNES and Wii Virtual Console. It is often called the iNES format, as it was created by Marat Fayzullin for an emulator called iNES. The format was later extended with NES 2.0 to fix many of its shortcomings.
