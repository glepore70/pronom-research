About NIX
The NIX project (previously called Pandora) started in the context of the Electrophysiology Task Force which is part of the INCF Datasharing Program. As such, the Task Force aims to develop standardized methods and models for storing electrophysiology and other neuroscience data together with their metadata in one common file format based on HDF5.

NIX is one approach to this problem: it uses highly generic models for data as well as for metadata and defines standard schemata for HDF5 files representing these models. Last but not least NIX aims to provide a convenient C++ library to simplify the access to the defined format. (more)

The NIX data model allows to store fully annotated scientific datasets, i.e. the data together with its metadata within the same container. Our aim is to achieve standardization by providing a common/generic data structure for a multitude of data types. See the wiki or the introduction for more information.

The current implementations store the actual data using the HDF5 file format as a storage backend.

NIX emerged from the activities of the Electrophysiology Task Force of the INCF Datasharing Program (2010-2015). It is a registered research resource with the RRID:SCR_016196.
