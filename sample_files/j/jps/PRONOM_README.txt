JPS is a format for stereoscopic images. A JPS file is simply a JPEG file that contains some special flags indicating that the image is to be interpreted in a nonstandard way. The physical image usually consists of two logical images side by side, though other arrangements are possible.

Identification
Files contain a JPEG APP3 segment, the first 8 bytes of which are "_JPSJPS_".
