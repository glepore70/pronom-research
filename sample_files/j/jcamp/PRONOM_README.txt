What is the SEDS?
The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has a long history in the development and support of scientific data standards. In 1995 IUPAC took over responsibility for the JCAMP-DX range of scientific standards from the Joint Committee on Atomic and Molecular Physical Data (JCAMP).

Since then a IUPAC Working Party has had responsibility for the support and development of the JCAMP-DX scientific data standards. In 2003 due to the increasing interest in the use of the Extensible Markup Language for data exchange the Working Party evolved into the Subcommittee for Electronic Data Standards with oversight duties within IUPAC for all activities in either the JCAMP-DX sphere or the XML in Chemistry area. This Homepage continues to be dedicated to the JCAMP-DX standards. It includes pages dealing with individual projects related to technique-specific data standards as well as generic issues being handled by the Subcommittee directly.

ABSTRACT
The increasing power of modern spectroscopic data systems has led
to increasing use of mu ltidimensional techniques. These lead to
multidimensional data sets which need to be stored and exchanged
between computer systems. This protocol will describe the generic
form of the JCAMP-DX data storage format. It includes not only the
means to efficiently store and exchange multidimensional data but the
basic form for the production of future protocols for different
spectroscopic types
