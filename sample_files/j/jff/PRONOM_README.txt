JAWS ("Job Access With Speech") is a computer screen reader program for Microsoft Windows that allows blind and visually impaired users to read the screen either with a text-to-speech output or by a refreshable Braille display. JAWS is produced by the Blind and Low Vision Group of Freedom Scientific.

A Mayâ€“June 2021 screen reader user survey by WebAIM, a web accessibility company, found JAWS to be the most popular screen reader worldwide; 53.7% of survey participants used it as a primary screen reader, while 70.0% of participants used it often.[1]

JAWS supports Windows 10 and Windows 11 along with all versions of Windows Server released since Windows Server 2008. There are two versions of the program: the Home edition for non-commercial use and the Professional edition for commercial environments. Before JAWS 16, the Home edition was called Standard, and only worked on home Windows operating systems.[2][3] A DOS version, sometimes also known as JDOS, is free.

The JAWS Scripting Language allows the user to use programs without standard Windows controls, and programs that were not designed for accessibility.

The Process of Creating Frames
To create a frame, do the following:

Put the PC cursor in the window or control that you want to form a frame around.
Press INSERT+F2 to open the list of JAWS managers, choose Frame Viewer, and then press ENTER. Focus moves to the "Options" button.
Press SPACEBAR to activate the Options context menu and choose "Create New Frame."
JAWS asks a series of questions to guide you through the process of creating a new frame. The first question asked is for the Frame Name. Give the frame a meaningful name (the default is "frame 1" if you have no frames already created).
The next screen asks you for a short synopsis of what the frame does.
The next screen asks you for a longer description of what the frame does. If the synopsis is good and easily understood, you may wish to leave this blank.
Next you are asked if you wish to assign a keystroke to activate the frame. Whether you do this depends on the frame and its intended use, it is not required, nor always necessary to assign a keystroke. However, in many situations, a keystroke can be helpful to allow you to repeat what the frame says or does.
The next decision is to determine how any text within the frame is to be spoken. Text echo can be set for:
None
Highlighted
All
Screen Echo, the same as whatever the current settings are for JAWS
Once this has been determined, focus moves to the "finish" button. Press ENTER and the new frame visibly appears on the screen. The title bar of the new frame will be the name given to it in step number four above.
While the frame has focus, press ALT+ENTER to go to a multilevel "frame properties" dialog box to further refine the frame and the events that are associated with it.
When you are finished working on the frame and close the "frame properties" dialog box, press TAB to move to the Frames dialog box buttons for more choices or press ESCAPE to leave the frame viewer. You are asked if you want to save the changes, with the focus on the "yes" button. Press SPACEBAR to save the changes and the frame information is saved in a JAWS Frame File (JFF) file for the appropriate application.
JAWS creates the JFF files automatically when you want to save a frame for an application. It will be named by the name of the application's executable file, with the JFF file extension. For example, if you create a frame for Microsoft Word, the frame will be stored in the Microsoft Word.jff file.
