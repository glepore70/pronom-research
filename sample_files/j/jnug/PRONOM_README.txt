Jack Nicklaus' Unlimited Golf & Course Design is a 1990 golf video game developed by Sculptured Software and published by Accolade for the Amiga and MS-DOS. A Super NES version with the same golf courses, titled Jack Nicklaus Golf, was released in May 1992. It is the second in a series of golf games named after golfer Jack Nicklaus, following Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf (1988).

The game includes a golf course designer that allows the player to create customized courses. The computer version was praised for its graphics and course designer, although reviewers criticized the long reanimation times in each version of the game. It was followed by Jack Nicklaus Golf & Course Design: Signature Edition (1992).
