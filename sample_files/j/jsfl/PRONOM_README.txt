JSFL (JS[JavaScript]FL[Flash])
JSFL is a variant of JavaScript specifically written to interact with the Flash authoring environment. Like Actionscript, JavaScript is based on the ECMAScript standard. So, if you have any familiarity with JavaScript, or ActionScript, you will find this knowledge useful in writing JSFL. It should be noted that JSFL and ActionScript are distinct languages with distinct purposes. The latter is compiled into a SWF, and that SWF can play in the ubiquitous Flash Player. Conversely, JSFL code is executed on the spot and is used to control Flash Professional itself. Thus, JSFL can accomplish nearly everything that a user can within Flash, such as create layers, create objects, select frames, manipulate Library items, open files, and save files. Additionally, JSFL allows you to script a few tasks that users cannot normally perform (at least not easily or quickly).

You create a new JSFL script by choosing File > New and selecting Flash JavaScript File in the New Document dialog box. The file extension for a JSFL script is always .jsfl. In this tutorial, you’ll start visually by copying user actions from the History Panel.

JSFL Obfuscated or Precompiled??
JSFL Obfuscated or Precompiled??
Post by Pier Paolo » Sat, 19 Jun 2004 00:27:04



Hi,
if you open the .jsfl files in "C:\Programs Files\Macromedia\Flash MX
2004\en\First Run\Effects" with a text editor you see that aren't text
file but they are like a bytecode compiled binary files. At begin of
these there is this string: "MACROMEDIAOBFU"; also if you open the
orginal PolyStar.jsfl in "C:\Documents and Settings\[user]\Local
settings\Application Data\Macromedia\Flash MX
2004\en\Configuration\Tools" you can read this string in a hex editor.
So, the .jsfl file are obfuscated or compiled in some way??
Do you know How?
Thank you very much!
