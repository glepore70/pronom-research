Developed by Kaspersky, the AVZ Antiviral Toolkit is a security tool ready to protect your computer against all kinds of threats. It is capable of detecting adware, viruses, spyware, dialers or pomware, as well as files that might pose a risk to your system and heuristics. Moreover, it runs scripts to automatically take action on suspicious files by sending them to quarantine or deleting them directly.

It was designed to run a complete system diagnostic that can offer additional information to the Kaspersky Lab technical support. In other words, if you go to Kaspersky’s tech support, they might ask you to generate a report based on AVZ’s analysis.
