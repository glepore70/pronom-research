Miles Sound System (MSS), formerly known as Audio Interface Library (AIL), is a sound software system primarily for video games and used mostly as an alternative for low-end audio chipsets. It uses little CPU time while providing adequate audio output. It was originally a middleware driver library for soundcards to use in DOS applications when no viable alternative was available. RAD Game Tools acquired the technology from Miles Design in 1995.

The 1992 AIL version 2 for DOS has been released by John Miles as open-source (public domain without restrictions) in 2000.[2][3] The package can be found on his personal site (KE5FX.com) and contains source code for both real-mode and protected-mode programs.

This package contains the real mode (AIL V2.14) and 32-bit protected-mode DOS (AIL/32 V1.05) versions of the IBM Audio Interface Library (AIL). AIL V2.14 and AIL/32 were the predecessors to the current Miles Sound System package published by RAD Game Tools (http://www.radgametools.com).

As of May 26, 2000, all source code and compiled object code in this package may be considered "open-source freeware," usable by anyone for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without restriction or limitation. I strongly encourage, but do not require, anyone who adds any further value to this package to release their modifications and improvements under the same terms.

I expressly disclaim any liability for bugs, defects, or intellectual-property violations that may arise as a consequence of using the contents of this package for any purpose, commercial or otherwise. Use at your own risk!
