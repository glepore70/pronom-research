What does "BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE" mean?
by Leo A. Notenboom

PGP SIGNED MESSAGE means that a message has been cryptographically signed. That means who signed it can be verified, and tampering can be detected.
I get email from some folks that have a line at the beginning:

BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE

And then near the end of their message there’s:

BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE

followed by some gobbledygook. Now I see that same stuff in some of your
responses to comments on your site. What’s it all about?

What you’re seeing is called a “signature”. It’s digital data that
accompanies a message, and is somewhat similar to a hand-written signature,
except for two important facts:

It can be used to validate that the message came from who it claims to come
from.

It can be used to prove that the message wasn’t tampered with.
