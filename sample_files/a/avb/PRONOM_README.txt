Microsoft Comic Chat was an IRC chat client that tried to represent a chat in the style of a comic book, with participants as graphical characters and their messages displayed in speech bubbles. It could use custom background and character graphics, given the extensions ".bgb" and ".avb", respectively. Characters and backgrounds were initially greyscale, but version 2.1 allowed the inclusion of color.[1] It was conceived, and its development led, by David Kurlander.[2] Comic Chat was released 1996 and last updated in 1999.[3]

 So you ask, "What is the difference between Comic Chat 2.1 and 2.5?"
There are actually several differences. Microsoft developed v2.5 to use compressed (character) .AVB files with an embedded url in the file. This advantage was to allow users to acquire each others comic characters in the background automatically while the users had fun chatting. It was an idea to be a convience! The backgrounds are also compressed into .BGB files. They are compressed in the same manner and also have an embedded url in them. The embedded url is where each user's program can download the character automatically. This is important because the other chatters would not know what character each one was using unless they had that specific character file on their hard drive. THAT basically is the big difference between v2.1 & v2.5!
