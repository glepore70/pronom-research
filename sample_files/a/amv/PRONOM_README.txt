The AMV is a proprietary file format (container format) created for the S1MP3 players to allow video playback without having to rise the costs of manufacturing. The video playback could have been another, like AVI for example, but often these formats need special hardware codecs and they have expensive license royalties. Also, the AMV format uses less compression and in this way there is no need for high power processors. This also leads to higher playback time.
