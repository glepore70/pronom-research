To obliterate all the Office Assistants on your system, go to \Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Actors and move all the files with the “act” extension to a new directory. (If you don’t find the “act” files in that subdirectory, search your hard drive with the Find command to locate all “*.act” files. Move them to a new directory for safe-keeping. I’m hoping that you haven’t created some important data files with the “act” extension that should stay put where they are.)
