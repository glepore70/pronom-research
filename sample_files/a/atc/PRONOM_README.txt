Tool Catalog (ATC) Files
 
 
 
Tool Palette applications publish their tool data to AutoCAD by storing information in ATC files. These files, which contain XML content, describe the tool palette components provided by the application. The ATC files that your application produces can be used in your installer to deploy your product.

Several different types of tool palette files use the .atc file extension. A working Tool Palette application usually provides at least three types of ATC files, as follows:

a registered stock tools catalog file
a workspace catalog file
a palette definition file (optional)
