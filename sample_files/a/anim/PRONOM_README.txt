ANIM is an animated raster graphics format that was widely used on Amiga computers.

It uses the IFF container format. The first frame is usually (more or less) in the form of an embedded ILBM file. The other frames use one of a number of available schemes for storing the differences from a previous frame.

NOTE: THIS FORMAT IS A VARIATION OF IFF X-FMT/157, HOWEVER I CAN'T GET THE HASPRIORITY WORKING CORRECTLY.
