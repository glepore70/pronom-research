First, you should know that WordPerfect Projects -- accessed via File, New from Project (or File, New in WP8) -- are really just automated templates. However, unlike the automation you can add to a custom template in the form of prompts or a template macro (see "Automating WordPerfect Templates" on the main Tips page), the automation part of a Corel Project is encoded in a special, separate disk file that has the same filename as the template but a different filename extension.

For example, the Memo Project is really composed of two files, Memo.ast (the automation part) and Memo.wpt (the template part).

The "ast" appears to stand for "assistant," and this file seems to be responsible for popping up the PerfectExpert pane on the left side of the document screen, as well as including -- in some Projects -- certain codes ([Named Region]) that perform automated tasks related to the PerfectExpert options in the left pane.
