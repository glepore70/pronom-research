A software wizard or setup assistant is a user interface type that presents a user with a sequence of dialog boxes that lead the user through a series of well-defined steps. Tasks that are complex, infrequently performed, or unfamiliar may be easier to perform using a wizard.

The feature spread quickly to other applications. In 1992, Excel 4.0 for Mac introduced wizards for tasks like building crosstab tables;[6] Office 95 introduced the "Answer Wizard" for querying help pages with natural language;[7] and Windows later used wizards for tasks like adding a printer, configuring an Internet connection, or installing new applications.[4] By 2001, wizards had become commonplace in most consumer-oriented operating systems.
