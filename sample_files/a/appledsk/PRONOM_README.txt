DSK's (.dsk, .do, .po, and .hdv files)

     DSK (usually .dsk) files are disk image files used by popular Apple II emulators
like AppleWin to run A2 wares on the PC or Mac. Usually, they are images of
Apple 5.25" game, utility, etc. diskettes. A standard 5.25" DSK file is 143,360 bytes
in length:

1 side x 35 Tracks/side x 16 Sectors/Trk x 256 Bytes/Sec = 143,360 Bytes.

DSK files of 800k 3.5" disks (819,200 bytes) are much less common.

     Data in a DSK disk image file can be arranged in the sector order used by DOS 3.3
or in the sector order used by ProDOS. The filename suffixes relate chiefly to how data
is arranged in the file:

.dsk- technically, this may be an image which has its data in DOS 3.3 or ProDOS order.
(The emulator program is supposed to check a .dsk file to determine the ordering used.)
It has become standard practice to use the .dsk suffix for only DOS 3.3 order files.

.do- an image which is in DOS 3.3 order. This suffix is seldom used today. DOS 3.3
order image file names usually end with ".dsk".
