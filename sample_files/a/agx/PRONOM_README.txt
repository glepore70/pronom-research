AGiliTy also has its own file format (with extension "AGX", which
stands for "Adventure Game eXecutable"); existing AGT games can be
converted into this format using the utility agt2agx which comes with
AGiliTy.

AGT (Adventure Game Toolkit) was created by Mark Welch and David Malmberg, but is not under current development. The AGT pages at www.markwelch.com/agt.htm provide a good starting point.

The AGT authoring system consists of a compiler and an interpreter (see Jonadab's listings at www.bright.net/~jonadab/if/).
