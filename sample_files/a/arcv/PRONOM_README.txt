Discussion
The documentation implies that the format was introduced in EDI Install Pro v2.8. It is the successor of EDI Install packed file.

Registered users of the software received an ARCHIVE.EXE utility to create such files, and a redistributable EXTRACT.EXE utility to decompress them individually.

The default file extension is .$00. In case of a name conflict, .$01, .$02, etc., will be used.

The format also supports file splitting. Fragmented files use extensions .@00, .@01, etc.

Identification
Files start with ASCII "ARCV".
