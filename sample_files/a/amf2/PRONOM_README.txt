AMF files are ADRIFT modules from earlier versions of ADRIFT. Newer module files are XML formatted. These files are related to .taf files (see earlier signature submission.)

ADRIFT (Adventure Development & Runner â€“ Interactive Fiction Toolkit), formerly called Adventure Generator, is an IF development system for Microsoft Windows, designed by Campbell Wild.

ADRIFT is intended for people who do not like programming, instead providing a series of dialog boxes which you simply fill-out with descriptions and properties of each location, object and character. It is a respected tool with a loyal user base and an active discussion forum.
