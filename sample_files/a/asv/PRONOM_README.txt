The #1 Multimedia presentation package, Astound 2.0 integrates the newest multimedia technologies with today's traditional presentation features. Astound lets you create incredible overheads, slides, demos, handouts, kiosk presentations, and more in minutes. Just choose from over 70 pre-designed templates, or create one of your own. Every template has incredible multimedia effects built-in, and it's easy to add text charts, graphics, sound, video, animated clip art and more! Replace traditional charting elements like bars and lines with 3D charts that bounce, tumble and grow. Add custom-generated backgrounds like clouds, marble or multi-colored gradations. Make objects appear or disappear with interactive buttons. Astound gives you complete control over all of your multimedia. Astound 2.0 also comes with the Astound Media Manager which allows you to catalog, organize, search and preview your multimedia files; and, as a special bonus, Astound Studio - a complete set of six fantastic multimedia editing tools!
