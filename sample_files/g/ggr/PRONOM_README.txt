A gradient is a set of colors arranged in a linear order. The most basic use of gradients is by the Gradient tool, sometimes known as “gradient fill tool”: it works by filling the selection with colors from a gradient. You have many options to choose from for controlling the way the gradient colors are arranged within the selection.
