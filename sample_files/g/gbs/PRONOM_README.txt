The Game Boy Sound System is a file that contains the code and data responsible for producing sound in a Game Boy ROM. A player must emulate the Game Boy's CPU and audio chip, the DMG-CPU B, and execute the code from the GBR file to play the music.

Early Game Boy music files were ripped into the GBR format, but the format didn't contain enough information to play back audio code that used some of the more interesting programming available to the platform. The GBS format, which houses similar data, was created with a more detailed header to give players enough information for accurate sound.
