ARCHICAD is an architectural BIM CAD software for Macintosh and Windows developed by the Hungarian company Graphisoft. ARCHICAD offers computer aided solutions for handling all common aspects of aesthetics and engineering during the whole design process of the built environment â€” buildings, interiors, urban areas, etc.

Development of ARCHICAD started in 1982 for the Apple Lisa, the predecessor of the original Apple Macintosh. Following its launch in 1987, with Graphisoft's "Virtual Building" concept, ARCHICAD became regarded by some as the first implementation of BIM.[1][2] ARCHICAD has been recognized as the first CAD product on a personal computer able to create both 2D and 3D geometry, as well as the first commercial BIM product for personal computers[1][3][4] and considered "revolutionary" for the ability to store large amounts of information within the 3D model.[5] Today, it has over 120,000 users.

ArchiCAD library part is the basic item through which the CAD software ArchiCAD handles external dynamic content elements which are grouped into libraries. A library part is a file in a library.

A library part can be any file used by ArchiCAD for the following purposes:

a file with GSM extension containing a model written in GDL or using 2D- or 3D binaries
a background image for rendering
an image for texture mapping for 3D and rendering
a text file for listing
a LightWorks material file (LWI)
a DXF file
a file of any type, which is registered by ArchiCAD or by an add-on as library part through Library Manager
Usually a library part refers to an object scripted in GDL.
