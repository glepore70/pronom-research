A file with the .GBA file extension is a Game Boy Advance ROM file. Itâ€™s an exact copy of a Game Boy Advance video game.

If you have a GBA file on your computer, it means that the game has been copied from the read-only memory (ROM) chip located on the console. You can use it on your computer or mobile device with an emulator, just as if it were being played on the Game Boy Advance.

Some Game Boy Advance ROM files might use other file extensions like .GB or .AGB, but they should still work the same as GBA files.
