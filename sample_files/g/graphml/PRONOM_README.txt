What is GraphML?
GraphML is a comprehensive and easy-to-use file format for graphs. It consists of a language core to describe the structural properties of a graph and a flexible extension mechanism to add application-specific data. Its main features include support of

directed, undirected, and mixed graphs,
hypergraphs,
hierarchical graphs,
graphical representations,
references to external data,
application-specific attribute data, and
light-weight parsers.
Unlike many other file formats for graphs, GraphML does not use a custom syntax. Instead, it is based on XML and hence ideally suited as a common denominator for all kinds of services generating, archiving, or processing graphs.
