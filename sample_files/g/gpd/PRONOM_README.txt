GPD files are used for creating Unidrv minidrivers. A Unidrv minidriver consists of a text-based generic printer description (GPD), which can be contained in one or more GPD files.

GPD files use the GPD language to describe a printer. The files contain GPD file entries that use the GPD language to provide the following types of information:

Printer attributes that describe printer characteristics.

Printer commands that control printer operations.

Printer features describing the printer capabilities that can be controlled by Unidrv.

Printer options representing the states that can be assigned to printer features.

Printer font descriptions that specify the characteristics associated with hardware-resident and cartridge fonts.

Conditional statements that describe dependencies between printer attributes and a printer's configuration.
