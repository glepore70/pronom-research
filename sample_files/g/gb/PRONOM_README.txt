A Nintendo Game Boy cartridge contains a ROM chip, for the most times a memory bank controller (MBC) and optionally a battery backed SRAM chip which may contain save game data. Files are typically using the GB file extension, or occasionally GBC if it's a Game Boy Color compatible game or program.

The file contains a header in the area $0100-$014F. This header contains information about the the program and the cartridge, such as title, ROM size, RAM size, type of MBC, which hardware it supports and checksums.
