guitarix virtual versatile amplification for Jack/Linux

a virtual guitar amplifier for Linux running with jack (Jack Audio Connection Kit).
It takes the signal from your guitar as any real amp would do: as a mono-signal from your sound card. Your tone is processed by a main amp and a rack-section. Both can be routed separately and deliver a processed stereo-signal via Jack. You may fill the rack with effects from more than 25 built-in modules spanning from a simple noise-gate to brain-slashing modulation-fx like flanger, phaser or auto-wah,
or you can also select plug-ins from the large list of LADSPA and LV2 plug-ins.
Though we design guitarix with guitar-signals in mind there is nothing wrong with connecting a synth or any other sound-generator with it
