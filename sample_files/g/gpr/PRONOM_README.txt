What is RHIDE?
RHIDE is an IDE (integrated development environment). It is NOT a compiler. With RHIDE you can develop and debug your applications written in C, C++, Pascal and other languages for which you have a compiler which can be called from RHIDE.


1.8.1 What are these so called projects
A project for RHIDE is a file, which contains all the needed information required to build a program or library from one or more source files. Also all the other options which belong to the look and feel of your desktop are stored there.
In general RHIDE creates for each project two files. One for the project itself (it has the suffix `.gpr') and one for the desktop related things (it has the suffix `.gdt').

To create a new project either run rhide with a not existing project name as argument or open within RHIDE a project by selecting a name which is not existent.
