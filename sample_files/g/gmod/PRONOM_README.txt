Golgotha is an unfinished video game that was being developed by Crack dot Com prior to shutting down in 1998. The game was to be a real-time strategy game, with elements from first-person shooter games. According to Dave Taylor, the game's name came from Shakespeare's King Lear tragedy, wherein Golgotha was a massive plain and a future battlefield.
