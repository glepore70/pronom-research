GIFBLAST is a GIF "recompression" utility, and its associated .GFB file format. It was developed by Isaac Dimitrovsky.

It compresses a GIF image file to GFB format, which is usually smaller. The GFB file can later be decompressed back to a GIF file that is functionally identical to the original, though it will generally not be byte-for-byte identical.
