Early versions of Microsoft Windows used a tool called Program Manager (aka progman) as its default graphics shell. This tool presented the user with several internal windows with icons in them for launching programs. Each of these windows was called a "program group" and was saved in a separate group file.

Windows 95 has provided an application for converting group files into directories within Start menu. It also redirected system calls for creating new program group items to creation of new items in the Start menu.
