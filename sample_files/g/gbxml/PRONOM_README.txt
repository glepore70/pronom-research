SIGNATURE NOT TESTED, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT OVER-RIDE THE GENERIC XML SIGNATURE...


gbXML (Green Building XML) is a format for describing the attributes, features, and layout of buildings in XML form. It is intended as a standardized format for BIM (Building Information Models) data (as opposed to proprietary formats such as DDS-CAD). (IFC is another such format.)
