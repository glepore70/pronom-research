geoPaint is a paint program included with the GEOS operating system. It has an associated raster graphics format. This article mainly covers the Commodore 64 version; there might be different geoPaint formats for other GEOS platforms.

geoPaint images use VLIR format, so they are not ordinary files. On non-GEOS platforms, they must use a transfer format such as Convert or D64.
