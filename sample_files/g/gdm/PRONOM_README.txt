see General Digital Music (.gdm).txt

General Digital Music / General Digimusic (GDM) is an audio file format used by the Bells, Whistles, and Sound Boards (BWSB) library. GDM modules commonly have the file extension .gdm As well as being somewhat popular in the mid-90s demoscene, BWSB was also used as the sound library for the game creation system MegaZeux from v2.50 until the system was ported to SDL and BWSB was replaced by ModPlug and MikMod, so .gdm files are often found in older MegaZeux games.
