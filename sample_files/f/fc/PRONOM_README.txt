Double precision math, object oriented code, a new image buffering scheme that results in up to 40x faster redraws and zooms. Did we mention 3D? All of the high-level 3D structures and entities from FastCAD/DOS 3D - A surface of revolution is retained as the definition, you don't lose the structure to command-level polygonalization. Plug-in rendering interfaces, with in-window OpenGL hardware-accelerated rendering and printing provided.

A new user interface. Hundreds of smaller improvements added at customer request. The use of both style gallery files, and screen controls that will list just those styles that you're using. Greatly enhanced customization. 24-bit color support throughout. User-defined 3D workplanes, enhanced XREF and multiple-drawing support. Multiple symbol catalogs and unlimited icon bars. And more. You need to check it for yourself.

While the 3D support will attract a lot of the attention, it is by no means all there is to V7. Every aspect of the program has been worked over. We feel that V7 will greatly enhance traditional 2D work, and remove bottlenecks. While 3D is "sexy", much of the real work to be done is 2D. We have a proven record of enhancing 2D capabilities with features such as V6's sheets, (added to V6 at no charge as a free update in 6.02).
