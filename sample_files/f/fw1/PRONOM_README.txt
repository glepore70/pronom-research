Framework 1.0
Originally created by Forefront Corporation for Ashton-Tate and first released in 1984, Framework was an early integrated office suite for DOS. It has a built in word processor, spreadsheet, database, outliner, graphing, and telecommunications.

Framework provides a text-based "gui", including windowing and menus. All of the different components behave in similar, consistent ways.

The Framework office suite is historically distinguished as the first all-in-one office suite for IBM PC compatible computers.

The spreadsheet component is also unique, as its design let it support "3D" spreadsheets.

Initially, Framework competed against Epson's Z-80 CP/M based Valdocs integrated office suite, and the Macintosh. It later competed against Lotus Symphony and Microsoft Works.

Wanted: Framework V, later versions.
