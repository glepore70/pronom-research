Flight Sim Toolkit
by Leonard "Viking1" Hjalmarson
 	
In 1994 Simis created Flight Sim Toolkit for the PC, running under Windows 3.1 and DOS. This title provided a suite of sophisticated tools allowing the game player to create their own flight sim world. January, 1994 PC Gamer called it, "A must for flight sim fans and frustrated programmers alike â€¦ Well designed, huge in scope and very absorbing."

The original FST still has a large and active on-line community, with dozens of active web-rings. Flight Sim Toolkit 2 will embrace this community with regular on-line updates to tools and engine features, news groups, and provision for exchange of maps and models.

Flight Simulator Toolkit (FST) is a suite of programs that enables non-programmers to design complete flight simulators in Windows. Terrain, flight models, aircraft shapes, and palettes are all customizable without programming. With an active imagination and some patience, you too can design flight simulators with FST.
