' This example demonstrates a key OLE concept
' regarding the interface "contract".
' The contract with the RoomMgr interface specifies that
' it will provide real-time, refreshed room information
' as well as enforcement of any and all business rules
' to any client that wishes to participate in the
' contract.  However, clients that wish to participate
' in the RoomMgr contract must support a Notification
' interface as part of the terms and conditions
' of their aggreement with the
' RoomMgr.  The actual way in which they implement
' that interface is up to them, as long as they adhere
' to the specifications of the interface as determined
' in the RoomMgr contract.

' To use this demonstration you should start up
' two or more Register clients and note how the
' RoomMgr keeps track of all collected client apps.
' Then, by clicking on a specific room within
' the grid control and pushing either the
' Available button or the Maintenance button,
' note how all clients are updated real-time
' with the new information from the RoomMgr server.

' Although this particular demonstration does
' not incorporate any data services, it's somewhat
' academic to see how it would.  What is interesting,
' however is to extrapolate from this example how
' the business components and data services might
' be handled in a full enterprise where you might
' want a centralized reservation server that
' maintains the reservation objects world-wide and
' is used by the individual RoomMgr servers to
' support both real-time reservations made
' at the hotel and
' through call-ins to a centralized 1-800 number.

    ' The above call provides the OLE server
    ' with the callback object to be used in
    ' updating the grid control.  The Connect
    ' function on the server is responsible for
    ' using this callback to initially provide the client
    ' with the current information on all of
    ' the rooms.  Note that even different client
    ' applications could potentially participate
    ' in these sorts of updates simply by
    ' implementing a Notify-like class that supports
    ' the same functions as this Notify class.
    ' This is the fundamental idea behind the interface
    ' contract whereby an interface is defined
    ' as a set of related functions that are
    ' expected to behave within certain general
    ' guidelines, but their actual implementations
    ' may differ.  In other words, in order for
    ' any client to participate in the "RoomMgr"
    ' contract, it must provide, as part of that
    ' contract, a notification interface defined
    ' in a specific manner.  Otherwise, it cannot
    ' participate in the contract.
