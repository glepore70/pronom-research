What Is an FXB File?
A file with the FXB file extension is an FX Bank file used with VST-compatible (Virtual Studio Technology) software to store effect presets, often called patches.

The FXB file contains a bank, or group, of presets that can be loaded into a VST plugin.

Single preset files are saved as .FXP (FX Preset) files.
