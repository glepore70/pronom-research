             *  an ASCII version of the system documentation,
             *  the install program,
             *  the program license agreement, and
             *  a number of files with a .fiz extension. Most of the pro-
                grams in the distribution kit are packed using the proprie-
                tary FIZ compression algorithm, and the only way to extract
                these files is to run the install program.

Most of the files in the distribution kit are packed using a
proprietary FIZ compression method, so you'll see a few files
with a .FIZ extension, some documentation files, and the install
program itself. The only way to unpack the .FIZ files is through
the installation program, so that's what you should run next.

When run, the installation program will display some copyright
information, and then proceed with the installation. It will ask
you where to place the contents of each .FIZ file; unless you
know what you are doing, or if want to use a different directory
structure, the defaults are recommended. To select the default
path, simply press at each prompt. (The installation
program will create directories which do not exist.)
