Xfig is a free and open-source vector graphics editor which runs under the X Window System on most UNIX-compatible platforms.

In Xfig, figures may be drawn using objects such as circles, boxes, lines, spline curves, text, etc. It is also possible to import images in formats such as GIF, JPEG, EPS, PostScript, etc. Those objects can be created, deleted, moved or modified. Attributes such as colors or line styles can be selected in various ways. For text, 35 fonts are available.

Xfig saves figures in its native text-only "Fig" format. Xfig has a facility to print figures to a PostScript printer too. A convenient feature is the PSTricks or PGF/TikZ packages code that allows a smooth integration of Xfig-generated images into LaTeX documents.
