THE FSB FORMAT, BANKS, STREAMS AND SENTENCING
Introduction         
FMOD Introduces a new format called .FSB, or the FMOD Sample Bank format.
This format is generated by the supplied tool. FSBank (fsbank.exe). It is mainly recommended for console formats, but can be used on any platform.
It is especially recommended for PlayStation 2, XBox and GameCube as it is a more optimal method of loading sound data into sound ram rather than using individual sound files which is slow and inefficient when coming off CD.
