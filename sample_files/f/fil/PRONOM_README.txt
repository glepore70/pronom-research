Filer 

DeskMate's Filer is a free-form data 
base manager that supports records 
with as many as 21 fields of up to 255 
characters each. You are limited only 
by your imagination in setting up the 
forms for the data base, so the variety 
of applications can be very flexible. 

You can search for and sort data by 
any field in the record. The Fl key in- 
vokes the Find function to search 
through the data base, and it supports 
a wildcard function.
