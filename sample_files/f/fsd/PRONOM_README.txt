Flight Simulator Toolkit (FST) is a suite of programs that enables non-programmers to design complete flight simulators in Windows. Terrain, flight models, aircraft shapes, and palettes are all customizable without programming. With an active imagination and some patience, you too can design flight simulators with FST.
