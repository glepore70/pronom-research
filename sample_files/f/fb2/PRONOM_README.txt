FictionBook is an open XML-based e-book format which originated and gained popularity in Russia. FictionBook files have the .fb2 filename extension. Some readers also support ZIP-compressed FictionBook files (.fb2.zip or .fbz)

The FictionBook format does not specify the appearance of a document; instead, it describes its structure. For example, there are special tags for epigraphs, verses and quotations. All ebook metadata, such as author name, title, and publisher, are also present in the ebook file. This makes the format convenient for automatic processing, indexing, and ebook collection management, and allows automatic conversion into other formats.
