Using the Project Viewer
Paradox treats each database as a project, and organizes the files that make up a project into
folders. The Project Viewer is a file manager that allows you to browse through folders and to
set the path where your files are located as your current working directory.
The Project Viewer window is divided into two panes. The left pane lists the objects available in
Paradox. The right panel displays the names of the files for the selected object type. Each object
is represented by an icon and each has its own file extension.
