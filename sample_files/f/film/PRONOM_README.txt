FILM is a multimedia container file format developed by Sega for use on
its early CD-ROM home video game consoles. Based on analysis of a number
of Sega CD and Saturn games, it appears that the format was first
developed sometime during the era of the Sega CD, the first CD-based
video game console. There are many early variations of the FILM format
observed on a number of Sega CD titles. Further, early FILM files have
been observed on at least one 3DO game (Lemmings).
