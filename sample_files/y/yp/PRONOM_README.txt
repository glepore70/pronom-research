Format details
YP format is a profile of Fastgraph Packed Pixel Run format. It uses a standard color palette, and a special header designed for compatibility. The header is 24 bytes, with two of every 3 bytes having value 0. Whether the header is specific to Young Picasso is unknown.

Identification
YP files start with bytes (hex) 50 00 00 50 00 00 52 00 00, containing ASCII characters "P", "P", "R". This probably stands for Packed Pixel Run, not Pablo Picasso's monogram.
