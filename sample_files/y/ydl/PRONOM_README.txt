YAODL (Yet Another Object Description Language) is a description language used for storing 3D object data to disk files. YAODL is a rather obscure format that was created specifically for the Silicon Graphics Powerflip demo program, and it is not widely supported by SGI. However, it is a simple example of a basic vector-object description language.
