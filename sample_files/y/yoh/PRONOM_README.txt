Abracadata software for Home Design and Estimating

21 June 99.
Abracadata is a software developer with a unique niche market: hobby and home design (improvement) specialties. Their "Design Your Own Home" (TM) series includes a number of good software titles geared more toward the "do-it-yourself-er" than the professional architect or builder. Yet there is one product that may be of interest to professional builders on the Macintosh and even architects who do a lot of small commercial and residential work. That program is Design Estimator.

The other programs in the "Design Your Own Home" series include: DYOH Architecture, a simplified CAD program for producing accurate and professional blueprints; DYOH Landscape, a similar program for landscape architecture; DYOH Interiors, an interior design program similar to the architecture program but for interiors; and DYOH 3D Design, a program that quickly creates floor plans, allows you to place furniture and then tour the design in 3D with its built-in rendering environment (QuickDraw3D-based, pretty sure of it). This last program allows you to explore your designs in a virtual "walkthrough", real-time rendered environment (at up to 15 frames per sec.). The systems requirements for all of these programs are minimal: System 7.1 and up, 68040 processor (FPU unit required for the 3D program, not sure about other apps) 8 MB RAM for the 3D program and up to 30-50 MB of hard drive space.
