Grand Theft Auto (GTA) is a series of action-adventure games created by David Jones and Mike Dailly.[2] Later titles were developed under the oversight of brothers Dan and Sam Houser, Leslie Benzies and Aaron Garbut. It is primarily developed by British development house Rockstar North (formerly DMA Design), and published by its parent company, Rockstar Games. The name of the series references the term "grand theft auto", used in the United States for motor vehicle theft.

Texture archives in the GTA III game trilogy go by the extension .txd (Texture Dictionary). The files belong to RenderWare's binary stream files. Since GTA IV uses the new RAGE engine, it also uses different texture formats. Textures are still stored in dictionaries but they use the extension .#td, where the first character is specific for each platform:

.wtd - for PC Version (Windows x86)
.xtd - for Xbox 360 Version (Xenon)
.ctd - for PS3 Version (Cell)
.dtd - for Xbox One Version (Durango)
.otd - for PS4 Version (Orbis)
.ytd - for PC Version (Windows x64)
Texture formats in texture archives may vary depending on platform - on the PC version they are usually encoded as DXTn textures or raw bitmaps. The Android and iOS ports of GTA3, Vice City and San Andreas can load 8-bit BMPs, although they use texture compression formats specific to the video hardware present in the device (i.e. Mali-400 for Samsung's Galaxy S2, S3 and various other devices, and Adreno or PowerVR for Androids using Qualcomm Snapdragons and Apple devices, respectively), as using bitmaps alone can present a significant performance penalty on the device.
