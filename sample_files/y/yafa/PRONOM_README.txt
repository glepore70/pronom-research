YAFA is an animation file format for Amiga computers. It is associated with people named Michael Henke and Andreas Maschke, companies named WK-Artworks and Infect, and software named Wildfire.

It is based on IFF. It can be compared to ANIM, though it appears to have only a little in common with it.
