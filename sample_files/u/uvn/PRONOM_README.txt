What a sound-packed powerhouse! The Tyros 4 is Yamaha's new top-of-the-line arranger keyboard, boasting 1,803 sounds, of which 15 are new Super Articulation 2 Voices that make non-keyboard-based instrument sounds (guitars, horns, strings, etc.) sound unbelievably natural - even when played via 61 keys! Plus, it features enhanced piano, guitar, drum sounds, synth sounds, and more - all inherited from Yamaha's renowned MOTIF synthesizer - to deliver an even broader, richer sonic palette. But the biggest leap forward the Tyros 4 makes compared to its arranger predecessors is in the vocal category. When it comes to sounds, playability, ease of use, the Tyros 4 excels!

Even when played via the keyboard, these new scat, gospel, and classic choir sounds rival those of any software-based sample library found today. And if you're ready to sing along, just plug your mic into the new built-in XLR combo jack - no special cables are required. The Tyros 4 also boasts 2-track hard disk audio recording and comes with its own large-capacity hard drive.
