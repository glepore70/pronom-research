Using Visual Studio* IDE Automation Objects (Windows*)
This topic briefly describes the Automation interfaces provided by IntelÂ® Visual Fortran. Automation interfaces are programmable objects used to access underlying IDE components and projects to provide experienced developers with a means of automating common tasks and allow a finer degree of control over the IDE and the Fortran projects being used within it.

You can use the Visual Studio* Object Browser (View > Object Browser) to view an object and its associated properties. Open the following in the browser: Browse > Edit Custom Component Set > .NET > Microsoft.VisualStudio.VFProject.

NOTE
The objects listed here are provided as an advanced feature for developers who are already familiar with using Automation objects and the Visual Studio* object model.
