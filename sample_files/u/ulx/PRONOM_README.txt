Glulx is a story file format for Interactive Fiction (IF) games. It is developed and maintained by Andrew Plotkin. The purpose of Glulx is to eliminate some limitations of the original Z-code format, most notably the file size limit. Glulx files may be stand-alone or they may be included in a Blorb archive.

For a non-Blorb file, the first four bytes are the ASCII characters "Glul". For Glulx files compiled by Inform, the ASCII characters "Info" are found at offset 36.
