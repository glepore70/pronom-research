Grokking the UHS
The UHS (Universal Hint System) is a system designed to help players who get stuck while playing (computer) role-playing or adventure games.

The Universal Hint System, better known by the acronym UHS, is a form of strategy guide used for computer and video games, created by Jason Strautman in 1988.

The strategy guides are primarily distributed in a UHS file format, readable using a UHS reader program.
