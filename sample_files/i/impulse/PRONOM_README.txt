Impulse Tracker is a multi-track music tracker (music sequencer). Originally released in 1995 by Jeffrey Lim as freeware with commercial extensions, it was one of the last tracker programs for the DOS platform.[1]

In 2014, on its 20th anniversary, Impulse Tracker became open-source software and the source code was released.
