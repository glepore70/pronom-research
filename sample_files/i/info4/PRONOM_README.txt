THIS FORMAT SHOULD BE CHECKED AFTER THE GLOW ICONS SIGNATURE AND THE NEW ICONS SIGNATURE. 
Files begin with bytes 0xE3 0x10. But make sure the file is not actually in NewIcons or GlowIcons format, which have the same BEGINNING signature.


Amiga Workbench icon is a family of unnecessarily-complicated icon formats used on Amiga computers.

This article describes the original format (sometimes called "Old Style icon", or something to that effect). For information specific to the newer formats, refer to NewIcons and GlowIcons.

An icon file is typically located alongside the file to which it is associated. For example, a file named foo.bar.info would be associated with the file named foo.bar.

Most files contain a second image, to be displayed when the icon is selected.
