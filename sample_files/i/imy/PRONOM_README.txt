In order to transfer these ringtones to a mobile phone, one could simply send an SMS message with the iMelody/eMelody text as the text of the message, or one could make a plain text file containing the iMelody/eMelody text and using the extension of either .imy for iMelody or .emy for eMelody and transfer the file to the mobile phone by bluetooth, IrDA (infrared), or by a data cable. The file could also be attached to an MMS message or an e-mail message.
