Since version 1.1, Irrlicht is able to save and load the full scene graph into an .irr file, an xml based format. There is an editor available to edit those files, named irrEdit (http://www.ambiera.com/irredit) which can also be used as world and particle editor. This tutorial shows how to use .irr files.

Now load our .irr file. .irr files can store the whole scene graph including animators, materials and particle systems. And there is also the possibility to store arbitrary user data for every scene node in that file. To keep this example simple, we are simply loading the scene here.
