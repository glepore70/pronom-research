ICARTT File Format Standards V2.0
Summary
The ICARTT file format standards were developed to fulfill the data management needs for the International Consortium for Atmospheric Research on Transport and Transformation (ICARTT) campaign in 2004. The ICARTT study consisted of eleven highly coordinated individual field experiments with over 300 government-agency and university participants from five countries, i.e., US, Canada, UK, Germany, and France. A common and simple-to-use data file format, ICARTT file format was established for this study to primarily facilitate data exchange and to promote collaborations among the science teams for achieving the ICARTT science objectives. The ICARTT file format is text-based and composed of a header section (metadata) with critical data description information (e.g., data source, uncertainties, contact information, and brief overview of measurement technique), and a data section. Although it was primarily designed for airborne data, the ICARTT format proved to be practical for other mobile and ground-based studies and various data types. Upon the success of the ICARTT study, the ICARTT file format has since been widely accepted in the atmospheric composition field study community and used in recent major airborne studies sponsored by NASA, the National Science Foundation (NSF), NOAA, and international partners.
