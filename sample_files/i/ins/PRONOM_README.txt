The RJP1 player/editor was written on an amiga 3000, it was fully multi-taskable and intuition based. The work was originally started by Alan Mcarthy, he started the initial frame work to the editor, then I took it over : created the replayers, soundeffect channels, and specialised effects with waveforms being able to modulate waveforms, sequencers, channels etc. For instance in one game the entire soundeffects and music score was around 30k. The replay code was basically used in a multitude of game from Sensible, Renegade and Bitmap Brothers last time I spoke with them, they had ported the code to PC's and the editor was being used for many years after the Amiga stopped shipping titles. In 95 they were still using it, and I believe Mike Montgomery of Bitmaps, ported the code to PC.
