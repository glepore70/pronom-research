Introduction
The International GPS Service for Geodynamics (IGS) provides precise GPS orbits,
earth orientation parameters (EOPs), station coordinates, satellite clock information,
and—on a test basis—tropospheric zenith delays. The IGS community is well aware of

the fact that the IGS network can also be used to extract information about the total
electron content (TEC) of the ionosphere on a global scale. One may expect that the
IGS will include TEC maps into its product palette in the near future.
As part of the 1996 IGS Workshop in Silver Spring, a first effort has been made to compare GPS-derived TEC maps produced by IGS Analysis Centers (CODE and ESA/ESOC) as well as external processing centers (DLR Neustrelitz and University of New
Brunswick) [Feltens, 1996a]. For this purpose, a very simple data exchange format
proposed by Wilson (JPL) has been used.
One essential conclusion of the ionosphere-related discussion was that a common data
format to exchange, compare, or combine TEC maps has to be defined. Based on a
first format proposal by [Schaer, 1996], which strongly follows the Receiver INdependent
EXchange format (RINEX) [Gurtner and Mader, 1990], [Schaer and Gurtner, 1996], and
[Feltens, 1996b], we present a revised version of the so-called IONosphere map EXchange
format (IONEX) that supports the exchange of 2- and 3-dimensional TEC maps given
in a geographic grid.
