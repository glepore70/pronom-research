IAGE (Internet Adventure Game Engine) is an Interactive Fiction development system by Robin Rawson-Tetley. Source code files are created in plain text, and then compiled by the IAGE compiler. The compiled games can then be played using the IAGE interpreter. IAGE is written in Java, and a Java Runtime Environment is needed to run the software.
