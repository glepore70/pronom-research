NewIcons (or NewIcon) is an icon file format associated with the NewIcons software for Amiga computers. NewIcons is a popular third-party utility that adds support for higher-quality icons.

The standard size for NewIcons images is 36Ã—40 pixels, though other sizes are common. They can have up to about 255 colors. Unlike the original icon format, the colors are not determined by the user's chosen color scheme.

See Amiga Workbench icon for more information about Amiga icons.
