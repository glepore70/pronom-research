ZoomBrowser Ex thumbnail cache (ZbThumbnail.info) is a file output by Canon's ZoomBrowser Ex image organizing application.
Documentation on the file is lacking but its purpose seems to be to support the display of image thumbnails in the Zoombrowser Ex application. Images are indexed and a lower resolution version created, and stored in the file, to be rendered as a thumbnail in the Zoombrowser window. ZbThumbnail files are created for each folder that is indexed by the tool. The file is created as a Windows 'hidden' file and its existence would not be known by the majority of users with a default configuration in Microsoft Windows. The file might contain information not elsewhere present in the Windows system. For example, even in a folder with no images, its existence suggests that images were once present and viewed using Zoombrowser Ex.
