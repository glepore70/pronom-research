The ZIM file format is an open file format that stores wiki content for offline usage.[1] Its primary focus is the contents of Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects.

The format allows for the compression of articles, features a full-text search index and native category and image handling similar to MediaWiki, and the entire file is easily indexable and readable using a program like Kiwix â€“ unlike native Wikipedia XML database dumps.

In addition to the open file format, the openZIM project provides support for an open-source ZIM reader called Kiwix.

ZIM stands for "Zeno IMproved",[2][3] as it replaces the earlier Zeno file format. Its file compression uses LZMA2, as implemented by the xz-utils library, and, more recently, Zstandard. The openZIM project is sponsored by Wikimedia CH, and supported by the Wikimedia Foundation.

The ZIM file format is based on the old and deprecated Zeno File Format. See also a walk through example at ZIM File Example. It starts with a header, which is described here:


Contents

2	MIME Type List (mimeListPos)
3	URL Pointer List (urlPtrPos)
4	Title Pointer List (titlePtrPos)
5	Directory Entries
5.1	Article Entry
5.2	Redirect Entry
5.3	Linktarget or deleted Entry
6	Cluster Pointer List (clusterPtrPos)
7	Clusters
8	Namespaces
9	URLs
9.1	Local Anchors
10	Encodings
10.1	Character Encoding
10.2	Integer Encoding
11	Split ZIM files

Header
A ZIM file starts with a header. This is offset 0.

Length in bytes, all types are little-endian.

All integers are unsigned integers (uint_16, uint_32, uint_64).

Field Name	Type	Offset	Length	Description
magicNumber	integer	0	4	Magic number to recognise the file format, must be 72173914 (0x44D495A)
