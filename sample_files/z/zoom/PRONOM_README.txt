ZoomScape uses a common image format with various extensions (.CMP, .CMS, .CMX, .IMG, .IMS, .IM2, .IM5, .OVL). They use an unknown compression scheme, but they can be inspected and decompressed using the T.EXE "ScapePic" utility included with some games. (source).

The files have the header LzH2. (is this related to LHA compression?)

Using ScapePic the following metadata can be read from image files:

Type (eg. "Image", "Movie", "Mouse-driven movie", "Cursor")
Size (pixels)
Scale (pixels/meter)
Full colors
Reduced colors
Uses fixed colors?
Uses transparency?
Is zoomable (has cuts)?
Compression factor
