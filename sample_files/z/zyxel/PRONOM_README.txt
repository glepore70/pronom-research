The ZyXEL Modems are capable of digitizing speech, the ZFAX software and
answering machine software like VoiceConnect store the sampled data in those
files. The Modems are capable of compressing the data down to 19.2k CPS (ADPCM)
and 9.6k CPS (CELP), the algorithms for the compression may be found in the
ZyxelVoc package by N. Igl, but as the firmware on the modems changes, so might
the compression algorithm. Playback on the modem is always possible.
