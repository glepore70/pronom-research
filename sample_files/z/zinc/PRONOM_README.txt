if you want to learn to program using OpenZinc, this manual is for you.
This book teaches programmers how to write robust programs using OpenZinc
Application Framework, the advanced object-oriented development environment that runs under nearly every popular operating environment in the
world.
OpenZinc's mission is to help programmers write object-oriented, graphical,
event-driven programs that are portable across operating systems, CPU
architectures, and languages and locales. Programmers often must deal with
issues like writing programs that run under multiple environments, or use
unrelated display technology, or that show text and data formatting in multiple languages like English, German, and Japanese. By design, OpenZinc makes
writing these programs far easier. But to achieve this, OpenZinc had to become
different from other programming environments—and this difference means
the programmer who is just starting out with OpenZinc faces the prospect of
learning something new. 

What is OpenZinc?
OpenZinc is an application framework that programmers use to write object-oriented, graphical, event-driven programs that are portable across operating
systems, CPU architectures, and languages and locales.
But more than a mere set of tools, OpenZinc is also an architecture, or a coherent
structure that follows a set of design principles. OpenZinc discusses these design
principles in detail in the first part of this manual. Briefly, however, in its
classes and member functions, OpenZinc uses specific design principles of eventdriven architecture, object orientation, portability, and flexibility. OpenZinc programs that use these classes and follow these principles benefit by how easily they port to different operating systems and CPU architectures, and how
flexibly they adapt to different languages and locales.
As we learn to write OpenZinc programs, OpenZinc's intuitive design will stand out
more and more—indeed, you will be able to anticipate how features of OpenZinc
will work without having used them. This quality is what makes OpenZinc attractive to so many programmers around the world.
