Using diff files for updating Kaspersky databases and software modules
A diff file describes the differences between two versions of a file of a database or software module. The usage of diff files limits traffic on your company's network because diff files occupy less space than entire files of databases and software modules. If the Downloading diff files feature is enabled on a distribution point, the diff files are saved on this distribution point. As a result, devices that take updates from this distribution point can use the saved diff files to update their databases and software modules.

To optimize the usage of diff files, we recommend that you synchronize the update schedule of devices with the update schedule of the distribution point from which the devices take updates. However, the traffic can be saved even if devices are updated several times less often than is the distribution point from which the devices take updates.
