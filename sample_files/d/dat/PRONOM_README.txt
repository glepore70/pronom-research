MULTI-SENSOR CAPABILITY
Geotekâ€™s standard Multi-Sensor Core Logger (MSCL-S) is recognised as a crucial step in many geological coring workflows, including those for palaeoclimate, mineral exploration, geometallurgy, oil and gas, nuclear or geotechnical. The MSCL-S operates by automatically moving core samples past a series of sensors. The MSCL-S benefits from a modular configuration allowing for a range of petrophysical and geochemical sensor technology to be integrated onto one core scanning system, producing a single depth co-registered data set. 

The MSCL-S may accept either whole/split unconsolidated sediment cores in liners, or whole/slabbed rock cores with or without a liner. Depending on the requirements of the project, each MSCL-S system can be setup to take depth co-registered measurements for each sensor between 1 mm and 100 mm intervals downcore with a position accuracy of better than 0.1 mm. Furthermore, if new technology becomes available, or research focus changes, the MSCL-S system can be upgraded with new sensors to ensure longevity of the scanning system.

The MSCL-S is field-proven with Geotek and many of our customers routinely installing their core scanner in remote onshore locations, or offshore laboratories aboard ships or platforms. Geotek can also provide containerised laboratory solutions for customers.

This is the directory in which all data relating to this core will be stored. Note that raw data is stored in a
binary format and has the extension .dat after the filename. These data files can only be read by the
application program. ASCII data files (which can be exported to other applications) of both raw and
processed data can be created as described later.
