The extended DSK image is a file designed to describe copy-protected floppy disk software. It's definition was defined by Marco Vieth, Ulrich Doewich and Kevin Thacker.

This format has been widely adopted and is one of the major file formats used (the other major format is the standard disk image with the "MV - CPC" identifier).

The extended disk image format should be used for copy-protected disc software, or in place of a standard disk image if the resulting image is smaller than in the standard disk image form.
