          INTRODUCTION
          ____________

          SaveDskF.exe  and  LoadDskF.exe  are  a pair of utilities to
          save a diskette to a file and vice-versa. These programs are
          not intended to save fixed  disk  images.   They  have these
          characteristics:

          ¨   Run under OS/2 and DOS 3.3 or later.

          ¨   Empty sectors above the highest occupied sector are  not
              included in the file.

          ¨   The data may be compressed.

          ¨   Diskettes may be formatted as they are written.

          ¨   Standard diskette formats are supported.

          ¨   Conversion to a larger diskette image is possible.

          ¨   Label text may be included in the file that is  displayed
              by LoadDskF before the diskette is written.

          ¨   The progress of the data  transfer  is  visible  on  the
              screen.

          ¨   Built-in Checksum function.

          ¨   Handles "image" files generated by other programs.

          Efficient  portability  of  complete diskette images is pro-
          vided for transmission via data networks.  Boot, file  allo-
          cation table, directory and data sectors are included.  Both
          programs  provide  a  short help facility when some types of
          syntax errors are detected.  Just type the program  name  to
          get help.
