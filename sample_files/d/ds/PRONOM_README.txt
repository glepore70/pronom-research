A DrumSynth Preset is a file with settings for DrumSynth, which began as a standalone program from Maxim Digital Audio and then was released as the DrumSynth Live plugin for FL Studio (FruityLoops).

The files are in ASCII text form, with a series of Name=Value lines divided into sections beginning with lines with names in square brackets like [General], and blank lines separating sections.
