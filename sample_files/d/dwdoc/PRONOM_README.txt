DisplayWrite 5
DisplayWrite is a word processor that is based on the IBM Displaywriter dedicated word processing system. It directly competed with software ports of dedicated word processors such as the Wang Word Processing System (or its clone MultiMate ), Lanier Word Processing Software, Xerox, DEC, or similar.

DisplayWrite was among IBM's first internally developed, commercially sold PC software products, and was the first IBM released word processor after the much derided EasyWriter.

It was heavily based around the idea of document interchange and interoperability between IBM's desktop and mainframe products. Despite that, it had very poor interoperability with non IBM products, and supported only a tiny handful of IBM printers.

Later in its life, IBM produced a seperate product called IBM DisplayWrite Assistant, with a user interface similar to IBM Writing Assistant but with features of and interoperability with DisplayWrite. This was intended to bridge the gap with their entry level "Assistant" product line.
