Here is some information on the Miles "Protected-mode" AIL v3 DOS audio drivers which may help in your quest to get the last released versions identified. The time/date and size of the Miles Audio AIL v3 file may help, but internally there are usually text strings in the MDI files which usually have an AIL33xx string embedded within the file. There is also an internal embedded version number located at byte position 0x8 and 0x9 (zero-based start) of both the DIG and MDI files.

Here is an example of the Gravis Ultrasound Miles AIL3 version 3.11 release originally dated 03-25-1995. Note that the internal version is 1.12 while the external release version was 3.11 - a bit strange. I believe that once the protected mode AIL3 drivers were released that the external numbers were always 3.xx - but someone made a mistake when these Gravis Ultrasound were labeled 3.11. Probably should have been 3.12 instead. Who knows at this point?

Example:  ULTRA.DIG (Gravis Ultrasound) Miles driver version 3.11  ( 9,478 bytes)
:0001.0000 41494C33444947         ; "AIL3DIG" string                     
:0001.0007 1A                     ; CTRL-Z
:0001.0008 1201                   ; version 1.12 (0x0112) 

Example:  ULTRA.MDI (Gravis Ultrasound) Miles driver version 3.11  (49,700 bytes)
:0001.0000 41494C334D4449         ; "AIL3MDI" string                   
:0001.0007 1A                     ; CTRL-Z
:0001.0008 1201                   ; version 1.12 (0x0112)
I have read on some now defunct forums that there was a set of unreleased Gravis Ultrasound AIL v3 drivers (supposedly v3.15) which actually worked and were stable on both actual Gravis Ultrasound ISA cards and Gravis Ultrasound software emulators such as the one built into DOSBOX and the Win32 GUSemu.
