DisplayWrite (sometimes written as Displaywrite) was a word processor software application that IBM developed and marketed for the IBM PC and PCjr. It was among the company's first internally developed, commercially sold PC software titles.[1]

DisplayWrite's feature set was based on the IBM Displaywriter System, a dedicated microcomputer-based word processing machine.[2] Because the two systems were so similar, an experienced Displaywriter user could start using DisplayWrite immediately.[3]

File format
IBM DisplayWrite's native file format is based on IBM's DCA (Document Content Architecture) RFT (Revisable Form Text) specification, but adds additional structures. Depending on the DisplayWrite version, the document files use .DOC or .TXT file name extension. The DisplayWrite software can export to and import from pure DCA/RFT files (which typically have .DCA or .RFT file name extension). RFT (IBM Revisable Form Text) should not be confused with RTF (Rich Text Format), which is a Microsoft specification.

NOTE: FILES WERE CREATED WITH WORDPERFECT FOR WINDOWS 5.2. EACH FILE WAS EXPORTED IN DISPLAYWRITE 4.0, 4.2, AND 5.0 FORMATS. IDENTIFIABLE HEADERS WERE ALL THE SAME.
