DeHackEd is an editor originally created for vanilla Doom that allows the operation of the executable to be changed. It was developed by Greg Lewis. Hit points, sounds, frame sequences, text strings and several other miscellaneous values can be changed. Modifications can be distributed in the form of DeHackEd "patches" which can be applied to the executable. In order to do this, DeHackEd has the ability to generate an exact copy of the Doom or Doom II executable, which by default is called doomhack.exe.

The most common patches add fast monsters and weapons, player-seeking-self-detonating barrels, and so on. However, more balanced and artistic modifications can and have been made. Even though many advanced effects can be achieved with DeHackEd, it does not offer the complete flexibility that a custom source port can provide. Monster AI and armor classes are fixed for example.
