1)CorelDraw 8

This came bundled with CorelDream 3D (now discontinued) and used (among others) the .stiff extension - shortened to .sti
The package was a very good attempt to 'simulate' 2D into 3D, with animation included, in fact, a very good package all round.

2)Metacreations RayDream Designer 4

This software was bought up by Corel and re-named CorelDream 3D. Again, this is no longer available.

As for the CorelDraw 8, subsequent releases are minus the Dream 3D. Not only that, even if you managed to get a copy, there are serious problems getting it to run on XP.
