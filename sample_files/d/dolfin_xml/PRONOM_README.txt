For some reason I can't get this signature to have priority over the fmt/101 XML signature.


8.2.1 DOLFIN XML
DOLFIN XML is the native format of DOLFIN. As the name says, data
is stored in XML ASCII format. This has the advantage of being a robust
and human-readable format, and if the files are compressed there is little
overhead in terms of file size compared to a binary format.
