The Digital Music Files are high quality MOD style files with up to
32 channels/1024 beats per track. The X-Tracker by the demo group
D-Lusion produces this format. In general, the format is well organised
due to the ID/Blocklength structure wich makes downward compatibility to
older version files easy, but the Version 4 (current version) of the file
format, produced by X-Tracker 0.30Î² still requires some manual scanning for
the next ID which I regard as not so nice. Version 5 of the format has the
[SEQU] block length fixed, but the [SMPD] block has the length 0.
