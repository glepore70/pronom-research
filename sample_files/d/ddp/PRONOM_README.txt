Delphi produces various files for each project, and you should know what they are and how they are named. Basically, two elements have an impact on how files are named: the names you give to a project and its units, and the predefined file extensions used by Delphi. Table 1.1 lists the extensions of the files you'll find in the directory where a Delphi project resides. The table also shows when or under what circumstances these files are created and their importance for future compilations.
