Description
Sometimes referred to as D-Lusion / Delusion Music Format or D-Lusion / Delusion Digital Music Format, D-Lusion Music File (DMF) files are modules created by X-Tracker, a tracker for MS-DOS. The xtracker32 project planned to extend the format, but appears to have been delayed since late-2001 and can be presumed dead (although it was apparently in closed beta, so some files / source may remain in existence).

The file format version identifier at offset 04h can tell you which version of X-Tracker was used to create the file:

Tracker Version / File Format Version
Version Number
X-Tracker beta	1-7
X-Tracker final	8
xtracker32	10
