In this directory are sample of two new formats of Stata .dta files. Both seem to follow existing Stata signatures (see below.)


EXISTING SIGNATURES
68(01|02)0100{5}00
69(01|02)01{56}00
6E(01|02)01{105}00
6F(01|02)01{105}00
71(01|02)01{105}00
72(01|02)01{105}00
73(01|02)01{105}00

NEW SIGNATURES
6c(01|02)01{105}00 TYPE 1
66000100 TYPE 2 NOT ENOUGH SAMPLES TO DEVELOP SIG

Note that these sigs imply additional formats (6D and 67 first bytes.)
