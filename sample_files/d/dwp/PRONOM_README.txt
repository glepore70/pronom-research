DirectWave is a sample player and is useful for traditional sounds such as Piano, Orchestra, Guitar etc. There are many included sample banks, you can purchase more from the in-app shop or create your own (see below). There is also a thread on the FL Studio Mobile users forum (linked here) where many are available.

Where does DirectWave look for samples? - DirectWave will scan User Files for any WAV (8, 16, 24 or 32 Bit) and MP3 format samples. It will also scan for .instr and .dwp multi-sampled instruments (see below).

Make your own multi-sample instruments
DirectWave will load .wav, .mp3, .dwp (DirectWave Presets) and .instr (FL Studio Mobile Instrument). While .mp3 and .wav are restricted to a single sample, played across the keyboard, .dwp and .instr formats support multi-samples, where each key can contain a unique sample or sound. About .dwp files; These are native to the FL Studio DirectWave Sampler and there are two .dwp formats:

Monolithic - Contains all the multi-sample data in a single .dwp file. This is the ideal format for working on Mobile devices as it's a single file and easy to manage.
Standard (not recommended!) - An instrument patch includes the .dwp program AND associated sub-folder (with same name as the .dwp), that contains the sample data. This format is favored by FL Studio PC users as they can access and edit the patch sample data easily. However, as managing groups of files and sub-folders is complicated on mobile devices, we strongly recommend monolithic .dwp format instead.
