DSD (Direct Stream Digital) is a Sony/Philips audio format consisting of uncompressed audio at an extremely high sample rate. Its files are really really large, but audiophiles claim they sound much better than the lower-sample-rate, compressed files of other formats. Some question this, on the grounds of the quality differences being at a level well beyond the ability of the human ear to discern.
