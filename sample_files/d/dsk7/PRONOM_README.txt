The Sophisticated Operating System,[1] or SOS (/ˈsɔːs/),[2] is the primary operating system of the Apple III computer. SOS was developed by Apple Computer and released in October 1980.

In 1985, Steve Wozniak, while critical of the Apple III's hardware flaws, called SOS "the finest operating system on any microcomputer ever".[3]

Technical details
SOS is a single-tasking single-user operating system. It makes the resources of the Apple III available in the form of a menu-driven utility program as well as a programming application programming interface (API). A single program is loaded at boot time, called the interpreter. Once loaded, the interpreter can then use the SOS API to make requests of the system. The SOS API is divided into four main areas:

File Calls: Create, destroy, rename, open, close, read, write files; set, get prefix (current working directory); set, get file information; get volume information; set, set mark, EOF, and level of files
Device Calls: Get status, device number, information of a device; send device control data
Memory Calls: Request, find, change, release memory segment; get segment information; set segment number
Utility Calls: Get, set fence (event threshold); get, set time; get analog (joystick) data; terminate.
