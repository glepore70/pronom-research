Software Garden, Inc.
Software Garden is a small company that I head. It is known as the original developer of some popular products no longer being sold, such as Dan Bricklin's Demo Program and PageGarden. The products it currently distributes directly are listed on the Software Garden web site's Products page.

Dan Bricklin's Demo Program and demo-it!

Software Garden produced a variety of programs, including Dan Bricklin's Demo, Demo II, and demo-it! for Windows. These programs used to be sold and supported by Lifeboat Software, a division of Programmers Paradise (www.pparadise.com).

The latest version of these demo-making tools is Dan Bricklin's demo-it! for Windows Version 2.0. This program can be used to produce demonstrations, presentations, simulations, and prototypes of Windows programs and web sites. It runs under Windows 3.1, 95, and later (depending upon the screen driver and features used). For years I continued to use the program to do prototypes and demonstrations at Trellix. In fact, the tutorial for Trellix 1.0 and the sales demo for Trellix 2.0 were produced with demo-it! 2.0. The ChiaPaint demonstration joke was created with demo-it! 2.0, too, and you can download it here on this web site. The program is quite powerful and easy to use, and has an interesting user interface that Micah Zimring and I developed.
