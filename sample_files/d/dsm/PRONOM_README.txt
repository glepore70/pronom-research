Digital Sound Interface Kit Module Format (DSM) is a module file created for the Digital Sound Interface Kit software development kit. Developers needed to convert modules from MOD, STM, 669, S3M, or MTM formats into the DSM format. The SDK included a convertor program. Once in DSM format, developers could play the music in their program using the DSIK software library.
