You can found Geographical DRW PalDRAW files with 4 different
detail levels of the World Map.
You can get it at
http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ariel_rocholl/PALMTOP.HTM
and in Compuserve HPHAND forum.
More files will be available soon in those sites.
Because DRW files are ASCII, you can send it by e-mail.
So, you can cut and paste the next file to see the less detailed
WORLD4.DRW file in the Geographical Kit.
