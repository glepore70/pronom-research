Crosswareâ€™s Embedded Development Studio leverages the features of Windows to provide a development environment that allows the programmer to concentrate on the primary task of software development. It eliminates the learning curve normally associated with the use of a sophisticated tool chain, and provides an extensive range of features to help the programmer. It encourages a project-management approach with wizards and property pages to help with the setup process. It features a multi-threaded interface to multiple tool chains, an integrated feature-rich text editor with full context colouring, multiple terminal emulators, a source code browser, complete on-line books with full text searching, and a unique configuration system to manage startup files and target specific options.
The Embedded Development Studio comes with the Crossware tools of your choice. They will be integrated seamlessly into the Embedded Development Studio, allowing you to make your choice of target system from all of the options available.

As you write your source code in the integrated editor, context colouring highlights the language keywords and the assembler opcodes supported by your target system. The Embedded Development Studio works out the dependencies in your source code and displays all of the files in your project in a project tree. Editing any of these files is only a doubleclick away. When you click on the Build icon, your code will be compiled, assembled and linked in the background, allowing you to carry on with other important tasks.
