XPCOM type libraries, or "typelibs", are binary interface description files generated by the XPIDL compiler. Type libraries enumerate the methods of one or more interfaces, including detailed type information for each method parameter. Typelibs might be more aptly named "interface libraries", but Microsoft has already established a precedent with their naming scheme and we'll stick with it to avoid developer confusion.

Ideally, XPCOM typelibs would be binary-compatible with those generated by Microsoft's MIDL compiler, but the MS typelib format is proprietary. Thus, this document specifies a format quite different from the Microsoft format.

Note that the typelib is not merely a tokenized form of the IDL.  Rather, it's intended to accurately represent binary XPCOM interfaces, with annotations derived from the IDL.
