XPK is a compression program that stores files using a variety of methods,
including compressors such as NUKE, PowerPacker, and Imploder. While in
many ways similar, the advantage to XPK is that it supports more file
formats than other compressors, due to plug in modules (shared libraries)
that are written for XPK to use. If you are using Imploder or PowerPacker,
you should have no problem switching to the more flexible XPK.
