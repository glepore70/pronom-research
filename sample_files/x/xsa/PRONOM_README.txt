XSA Format
Last updated on: August 18 1998
The XSA (XelaSoft Archive) format is a special compression format which I designed to be able to distribute raw disk images (DSK files) via the internet. I have developed various programs that support the XSA format. Some programs compress directly from a floppy disk to an XSA file or vice versa. Other programs can be used to compress or decompress directly from DSK files to XSA files or vice versa. The latter ones are actually general compression programs which can be used to compress/decompress arbitrary files. Though, they are mainly used for disk images.

XelaSoft Archive (.xsa)
-----------------------

The XelaSoft Archive is a compressed file. It can only contain one
file. Although it can contain any file, it's always used for MSX disk 
images. The were programs written by XelaSoft which made a dump
of a disk, and compressing them at the same time. Very useful to store
a disk dump on another disk. zip/gzip offer much better compression and
are mainstream, so let's stick with that.

imgtool uses XSA code developed by Alex Wulms/XelaSoft.
