STATUS: Development in progress. Check the mailing list for further information (email <majordomo@jurai.org> with the words "subscribe xgs-list" in the body of the letter) or the development mailing list (email <majordomo@jurai.org> with the words "subscribe xgs-dev" in the body of the letter).

SHORT DESCRIPTION: XGS emulates a ROM03 Apple IIGS, with the following features: CPU and memory map emulation, graphics modes up to super high resolution, ADB keyboard, clock chip, battery RAM, IWM hardware emulation for Slot 5 & 6 drives, ProDOS block device in Slot 7 and classic Apple ][ sound. Further IIGS features such as Ensoniq sound and GS/OS 6 capacity will be added in future releases.

ROMS: XGS does not come with the necessary ROMs. The emulator requires a copy of the Apple IIGS ROM03 - these ROMs can be copied from your Apple IIGS by following the procedures in the "README" text file included with the package. ftp://ftp.apple.asimov.net/pub/apple_II/emulators/rom_images/

DISK-IMAGE FORMAT: 2IMG universal format, from version 0.50. From version 0.50 onwards the previous proprietary image type is no longer supported. The archive includes a utility named "imgconv" to convert disk-images from the previous type into XGS image files.
