The dotXSI File Format
The dotXSI file format is an ASCII file format defined by Autodesk Softimage to store SI|3D and Softimage scene data. You can use it to simplify the import and export of characters, models, and animation for complete customization of any game-development pipeline. The file format lets you include user data, making it straightforward to introduce new types of custom information.

The dotXSI file format is optimized for current game engine technology, and it can be easily:

• Imported into and exported from SI|3D (v4.0 and later) and Softimage.

• Used to exchange scene data between SI|3D and Softimage.

• Imported into third-party software.

• Converted into other file formats.

• Extended and customized to meet any special needs.
