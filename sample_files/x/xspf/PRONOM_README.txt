XML Shareable Playlist Format (XSPF), pronounced spiff,[1] is an XML-based playlist format for digital media, sponsored by the Xiph.Org Foundation.

XSPF is a file format for sharing the kind of playlist that can be played on a personal computer or portable device. In the same way that any user on any computer can open any Web page, XSPF is intended to provide portability for playlists.
