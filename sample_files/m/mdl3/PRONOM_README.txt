SANSPRO V.5.10
About SANSPRO

SANSPRO (Structural Analysis and Design System) is a fully integrated software developed by ESRC for helping structural engineers in designing various kind of buildings and other structures. The program has been designed for local market and very affordable for local engineers.

 SANSPRO has the following features:

 General features:

 - Interactive 3D Modeling using Layout Oriented Method

- Visual Report (Color Code)

- Comprehensive Steel Database

- ELSET element data tables

- Large Model Size using Virtual Memory

- Linear Static, Static Equivalent, Dynamic Time History, Dynamic Response Spectrum Analysis

- Nonlinear Static Analysis

3. Introduction to SANSPRO Program
SANSPRO is an Integrated Software for Structural Modeling, Finite Element Static & Dynamic Analysis, Steel and
Concrete Design, Foundation Design, Volume & Cost, and Detail Drawing Generator. Using integrated approach, user
needs only to enter a single comprehensive model, then other process such as analysis, design and reporting will be
done using the same model.
SANSPRO can be used for 2D or 3D structures and has a very comprehensive interactive building modeler using
layout oriented approach. It has capabilities to do static and dynamic spectrum response analysis, and also Direct
Integration (Time History) Analysis. For building with stage construction, a sequential load analysis can be done to
reflect more accurately the distribution of gravity load during construction, especially for transfer beam and bracings.
