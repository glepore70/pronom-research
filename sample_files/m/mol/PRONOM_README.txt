 The Tripos mol2 file format presents many advantages (it handles force field atom types, atomic charges, atom and residue names, atom connectivitities, etc...). Consequently, this file format is the main output generated by the R.E.D. program and the R.E.D. Server server. The R.E.DD.B. database stores RESP and ESP charge values and force field libraries for small molecules and molecule fragments in this Tripos mol2 file format. The LEaP program available in the AmberTools and many programs (Jmol, VMD, Openbabel among many others) also recognize this file format.
However, in the concept of a force field library the Tripos mol2 file format has some limitations as well. Thus, when one wishes to build a polymer from a set of molecular fragments the Tripos mol2 file format does not handle information about the connecting atoms between molecular fragments (i. e. the head and the tail atoms of each fragment). Consequently, we have developed a new force field library file format, named "mol3 file format". This new file format is based on the Tripos mol2 file format to which information about the connecting atoms for molecular fragments can be added. In the future, this file format will be further developed, and it will be the main format used by R.E.D., R.E.D. Server and R.E.DD.B.
