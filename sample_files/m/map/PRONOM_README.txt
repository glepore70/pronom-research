Rob Northen compression
Rob Northen compression (RNC) is a multi-platform compression format created by Rob Northen in 1991. It is a variant of LZSS and Huffman Coding. Decompression libraries have been written for the PC, Mega Drive, Game Boy, SNES and Atari Lynx. RNC is used in a number of games by UK developers (notably Bullfrog and Traveller's Tales), including Sonic 3D: Flickies' Island, Blam! Machinehead, Dungeon Keeper 2, Magic Carpet, Syndicate and Syndicate Wars. It generally yields a 3:1 compression ratio.[1]
