MGui (MORELLO Graphic User Interface) is a cross-platform graphical user interface written in ANSI C, also providing a C++ API via a frame library. It consists of a library, including all typical GUI objects as menu, push buttons, editable fields, lists etc... and a code generation tool (MGui Designer), which allows the user to create and maintain application window layouts using the mouse.
MGui makes it possible to create applications for Windows 3.1, Windows 95/98/NT, Unix X-Window, DOS (Borland, Watcom and DJGPP) with no knowledge about the host system graphics API. You can simply use the MGui Designer code generator to create window layouts, and write your code to interact with the created Objects.

For its features, MGui is useful to everyone who wants to realize multi platform applications, with absolutely no GUI porting needs.
It's ideal for use in DOS based embedded systems in both real mode and DPMI.

Note: MGui 4.0 is no longer supported under BGI real mode and Windows 3.1
