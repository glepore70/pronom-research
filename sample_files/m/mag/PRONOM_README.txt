MAKIchan Graphics (also spelled Maki-chan) is a family of raster graphics formats that were used mainly in Japan. It may be associated with MSX computers. It's been accused of having an overly-complex compression scheme.

There appear to be three main subformats: MKI (or MAKI), MAG, and MAX. MAG is probably the most common. MAX is a slight variant of MAG, and uses a native MSX color model known as YJK.
