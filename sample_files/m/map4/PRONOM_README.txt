Location data adds both insight and complexity to corporate decision making. Mistakes are too expensive for a trial-and-error approach to mapping. If you’ve opened a new shopping mall, you can’t relocate it once you realize your location intelligence was bad and you’re not drawing the crowds you need.

MapInfo Pro GIS software employs geospatial analytics and location intelligence to help you create insightful models of location-centric scenarios. Use these models to simulate different outcomes — then act with confidence.

Use MapInfo Pro to:

Better understand a location by gathering information about its key features and how they interact. Visualize data through map symbols, themes, and labels. You can even overlay multiple datasets on a single map to distinguish patterns that would not otherwise be visible.
