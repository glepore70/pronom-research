In September 2005 Spike, the main developer of FTEQW, brought FTE QuakeTV to the scene. In the shadow of the holiday scene dormancy it remained kind of unnoticed. Disconnect, member of MVDSV team finished QTV support in MVDSV just in the end of September 2005, which was unnoticed too, due to lack of new official MVDSV build.

However VVD promised new MVDSV release in a few weeks. I've finished a FTE QuakeTV Guide today. Now what the heck is QuakeTV?
Quote:
FTE Quake TV is a QuakeTV proxy made by the FTE team.
It transfers MVD data (known as MultiViewDemo files) over TCP. The result is a reliable buffered connection, providing smooth action.

FTE QuakeTV seeks to replace Qizmo observer mode when observing crowded matches.
