Probe Set Data in MAGE-ML Format
Email Email | Print Print
We provide annotation data for our GeneChipÂ® catalog arrays in multiple formats. This document describes how we have encoded our array annotations in the MAGE-ML format in files available on the support pages for each array.

Understanding the MAGE-ML Probe Set Files
This document describes how we have encoded annotations for probe sets in our GeneChip catalog arrays in downloadable XML files using the MAGE-ML format. Before reading this document, you may wish to familiarize yourself with more general information about the MAGE-ML format

Note that to use the XML files, you generally need a copy of the MAGE-ML.dtd file, available at the MAGE-ML support page of the MGED Society (Microarray Gene Expression Data Society). Our XML files assume this DTD file will be located in the same directory as the XML files.

The MAGE-ML format allows a great deal of flexibility in how some types of data can be encoded. In order to maximize compatibility with files generated by other groups, we have chosen to follow the recommendations of the European Bioinformatics Institute with respect to these, and other, elements:

<BioSequence> identifiers
<Database_ref> identifiers
<OntologyEntry> categories and values
Species names

For annotations that are unique to Affymetrix, or for which standards have not yet been developed, we use only the <NameValueType> XML element, with each name attribute beginning with "Affy:".

The structure of each MAGE-ML annotation file follows the following general outline:
