* ------------[ BLED merge (c) Ken Goosens ]-------------
* This merge allows you to use PEEKER by Mark Kimes in ANSI color mode!
* PEEKER is an online archive viewer for XBBS, but can be used with RBBS.
* With PEEKER you can let your users view, extract, and even compress and
* download pieces of files!  PEEKER requires a fossil driver but who doesn't
* use one???  It also supports those who multitask.  It can support ANY
* archive - past/present/future - through a configuration file.
* PEEKER is free of charge.
*
* This merge was originally for RBBS-PC 17.3C and has been found to work
* okay with stock RBBS 17.4 (no, I do not run stock code).  It basically just
* writes a "1" to to the temporary file that RBBS-PC writes to view an archive
* and you should pass this as the %3 variable to PEEKER.  See my sample batch
* file to get your feet wet, and Mark's documentation covers it also.  Feel free
* to drop me a note if you run into problems and I'll be glad to lend a hand.
