Tone Map 1 (Preset Enhancements)

ToneMap1.gifWhile Levels allows adjustment of three image areas, namely highlights, midtones and shadows, Tone Map allows up to 11 points for adjusting an images tonal range.

As with Levels, the histogram in the dialog box shows the distribution of tones in an image as a 256 point greyscale, with black on the left and white on the right of the horizontal scale. In addition, there is a line which can be moved and adjusted to alter the tonal range of the image. This line can be adjusted either using the preset enhancements from the pull down menu, or by adding customised control points to change the shape of the line, which then changes the images tonal range.

In the dialog box above, one of the preset adjustments (Darken Midtone) has been selected and applied to the Master channel. Similar adjustments can be made to the Red, Green and Blue (RGB) channels if required. The effects of any adjustments are shown in the righthand thumbnail.

Tone Map 2 (Custom Enhancements)

ToneMap2.gifIf Tone Maps preset enhancements do not give the type of results required, you can produce your own custom adjustments by adding Control Points and dragging the line to remap the tonal distribution. To add a Control Point, select Custom from the Enhancement pull down menu, then use the mouse to click one or more points on the line. When the points have been added, use the mouse to drag each point into its new position. The effects of these changes will show in the righthand thumbnail image.

Its also possible to add Control Points to Tone Maps preset enhancements for further adjustment and refinement. After selecting an option from the Enhancement pull down menu, click the Use Control Points box, then click points on the line that you wish to adjust, and drag these into their new positions.

Individual Control Points can be removed by selecting the point with the mouse, right clicking, and selecting delete. To remove all Control Points you have added, click the Reset button.

In the example left, two Control Points have been added to the line related to shadow areas and midtones. The shadow area Control Point (bottom left) has been dragged downwards slightly to darken shadow areas of the image. The midtone Control Point was not moved, but added to keep midtone areas unchanged. This has changed the line from being straight, into a slight S shaped curve, which for many reasonably exposed photographs will give a good tonal distribution from black to white (and other colours in between). Photographs with more under or over-exposure will probably require a larger degree of adjustment.
