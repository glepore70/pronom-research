Maker Markup Language Specification
<Section>
Introduction
<Body>
Maker Markup Language (MML) is used to create formatted
FrameMaker documents from a text file. MML allows access to
many FrameMaker features.

<Comment *** The following Body paragraph contains an anchored
   frame.  The AFrame statement is equivalent to a MIF AFrame
   statement. (For a detailed description, see the online
   manual "MIF Reference.")  Inside the frame is a star. We
   just show this here so you can see how it is done.>

MML allows formatted documents to be created using both a
<if>GENCODE <pf>style of markup, in which document format and
content are separate notions,

and a formatting style of markup, in which actual formatting
specifications are intermingled with the document text.
