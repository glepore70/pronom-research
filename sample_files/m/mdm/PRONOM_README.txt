HLM software has been one of the leading statistical packages for hierarchical linear modeling due to the pioneering work of Stephen Raudenbush
and Anthony Bryk, who created the software and authored the leading text
on hierarchical linear and nonlinear modeling (Bryk & Raudenbush, 1992;
Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). Though differences among software packagesâ€™ capabilities have diminished over time, HLM 7 offers a number of appealing advantages and capabilities. Among these are what many consider to be a more intuitive
model specification environment, greater ease in creating three- and four-level
models, its wide choice of estimation options, integrated likelihood ratio hypothesis testing, graphics options, and the ability easily to handle heterogeneous
hierarchical linear models (where the dependent is thought to have different error
variances for different levels of some grouping variable such as Agency).
HLM SOFTWARE
Scientific Software International (SSI) distributes HLM 7. A free student edition
of HLM 7 is available.1

HLM software stores data in its own multivariate data matrix (MDM) format,
which may be created from raw data or from data files imported from SPSS, SAS,
Stata, SYSTAT, or other packages. MDM format files come in flavors keyed to
the several types of HLM modules noted above. File creation options are accessed
from the HLM File menu, illustrated in Figure 3.1 below. The example below
illustrates data entry from an SPSS .sav file for models of type HLM2, but similar
procedures are followed for other model types
