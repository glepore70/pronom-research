Freyja 3d is a modeler and animator focusing on low polygon game content with wide range of model import/export plugins. Freyja has some unique features such as Lua macros, tools for reverse engineering, and use of GLSL shaders while editing. Currently supported platforms: Linux, PS3Linux, Windows, and OS X

The modeler and main libraries are written mostly in C++ with bindings for C, Lua, and Python. The user interface is written in a custom Gtk+ 2.0 binding for Lua, which means it is possible to customize the interface to your needs just by editing a few simple scripts. Included are a domain specific STL, physics library, and material system. Also there are tools for batch conversion, offline processing, and data extraction.
