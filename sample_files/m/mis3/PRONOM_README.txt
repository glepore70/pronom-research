Starsiege is a mecha-style vehicle simulation game developed by Dynamix and released in 1999. Starsiege is set in the Metaltech/Earthsiege universe, which contains its predecessors Earthsiege (1994), Battledrome (1994), and Earthsiege 2 (1996). This universe also includes action game Hunter Hunted (1996),[citation needed] strategy games Mission Force: Cyberstorm (1996) and Cyberstorm 2: Corporate Wars (1998). It also includes the sequels Starsiege: Tribes (actually released before Starsiege) and all subsequent Tribes titles. In 2015, this game and the rest of the Metaltech/Tribes series were released as freeware by Hi-Rez Studios, but Battledrome and the Cyberstorm series were not.[2]

\\ Create vehicle file //

First, you need to launch the Starsiege Mission Editor.

Start => Run => " C:\Dynamix\Starsiege\Starsiege.exe -me " Starsiege will start normally. Go to " MULTIPLAYER " and create any game, then click on " JOIN ".

Voila, you have just activated the mission editor.

Click on " NEW ", at the top left, give your mission a name, and validate the other options (terrain, etc.), then click on " CREATE ". After a few seconds, you hear a soft voice say to you: " MISSION COMPLETE " Click on " F4 ", then on " F3 " to add a new vehicle. A window appears at the bottom right, choose your vehicle, and click on its name. Click " F2 " to modify your vehicle. A window appears at the bottom right, this is where you will configure your vehicle. You do what you want, but 2 options must be set:

- Driver => NONE
- Team => NEUTRAL

Forget it, and Starsiege will always crash!
Always keep the vehicle weight below the maximum weight. To place special weapons, you must have previously modified the " ***.cs " file of the vehicle. Once done, click on " APPLY ", then on " LOCK "  and then on " SAVE " (top left). You lose use of the mouse for a few seconds. When you find it, click on " F5 ", on " ESCAPE " then quit the game and the game.

Now go to the Starsiege folder. You will find 2 new files there: " ***.mis " and " ***.ted.vol " (*** is the name you gave to the mission) Open the " ***.mis " file, with Notepad for example.
This is what it will look like:

SIMGu SIMG~ SVol' ÿÿÿÿ Desert.Sim.vol SVol+ ÿÿÿÿ Surpressor.ted.vol terrainVol tedVolSIMGf ESpt% @ ÿÿÿÿ Desert.d.ppl STERo @ ÿÿÿÿ @Æ @Æ €;E úD zD úD ðB C Surpressor.ted.dtf ÍÌ Á @ F SKYTD @ ÿÿÿÿ tØ `êE @œF SKPLF @ ÿÿÿÿ wØ ðA€? €? €? úD p”F terrainPal terrain sky planetSIMG TANKB ÆF€1ñÀ\X¸À $% ”ý]q»³Ã/´Q ¶ U•vtla çÇ#u}\ô‚ ÊxÂ³¿7wÃ×œ` e± e Volumes world DropPoints Tank1           

Look for the word " TANK " or " HERC " or " FLYER " (depending on the vehicle you created). This is where the configuration file begins. Look for the word " VOLUME ". This is where the configuration file ends. Now, create a new text file that you will name " ***.veh ", still with Notepad (this is Windows Notepad), select from " TANK "  (included), up to " VOLUME " (not including the rectangle in front of " VOLUME ", but including the space in front of the rectangle), as in the example below:

[ TANKB ÆF€1ñÀ\X¸À $%”ý]q»³Ã/´Q ¶ U•vtla çÇ#u}\ô‚ ÊxÂ³¿7wÃ×œ` e± e ]

Without the square brackets, of course. Move your file to the " C:Dynamix\Starsiege\Vehicles " folder .
And voila, you have just created a new vehicle file .
