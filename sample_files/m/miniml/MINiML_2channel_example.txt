      <Biomaterial-Provider>Allen's Hatchery (Seaford, Delaware)
</Biomaterial-Provider>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Fertilized chicken eggs were placed in 37.5 C humidified incubator on embryonic day 0 and removed from the incubator on embryonic day 10.  Pituitary glands from 16 embryonic day 10 embryos were pooled, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 C until RNA extraction.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and was amplifed using a modification of the Eberwine Procedure (Phillips J, Eberwine JH 1996 METHODS: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology 10: 283-288). Briefly, 500 ng was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and an oligo(dT) primer containing a T7 promoter site (5'-GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATATCGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGGT24-3'; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).  Following second strand synthesis and purification, double-stranded cDNA was used as a template for in vitro transcription using the T7 MEGAscript kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and the resulting amplified antisense RNA was quantified with the Ribogreen RNA Quantitation Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Cy3</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
1 microgram amplified antisense RNA (equivalent to 1 microgram mRNA) was converted to cDNA using random primers with the Amino Allyl cDNA Labeling Kit (Ambion), and Cy3-monoreactive NHS esters (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) were coupled to the cDNA.  Labeled cDNA was purified from unicorporated dye using CyScribe GFX Purification Kit (Amersham Biosciences).

      <Label>Cy5</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
1 microgram amplified antisense RNA (equivalent to 1 microgram mRNA) from the pool was converted to cDNA using random primers with the Amino Allyl cDNA Labeling Kit (Ambion) and Cy5-monoreactive NHS esters (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) were coupled to the cDNA.  Labeled cDNA was purified from unicorporated dye using CyScribe GFX Purification Kit (Amersham Biosciences) and a pool was made of all Cy5-labeled cDNA to be split among the 16 slides in the experiment.
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The microarray was hybridized overnight at 42 C with Cy3-labeled embryonic day 10 cDNA and an aliquot of the Cy5-labeled reference pool cDNA using microarray hybridization buffer (Amersham Biosciences).  Slides were washed in increasing stringency using salt sodium citrate.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
The microarray slides were scanned using a 418 confocal laser scanner (Affymetrix) at 550 nM for Cy3 and 649 nM for Cy5 to generate two TIFF images for each slide.
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
Chicken embryonic pituitary gland, embryonic day 10, replicate 1
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The two images from each slide were processed with Spotfinder version 2.2.4 (The Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, MD) using the following settings:  Otsu thresholding algorithm (minimum spot size 3 and maximum spot size 25); keep flagged values; keep raw data; and quality control filter set so 50% cutoff equals background plus 1 standard deviation.  Data were normalized using Microarray Data Analysis System (MIDAS) version 2.18 (The Institute for Genomic Research).  In MIDAS, channel A and B flags and channel A and B background checking were used, and the signal-to-noise threshold was set at 3.0.  Data from the Cy3 channel were first Lowess (LocFit) normalized by pin (block) using a smoothing parameter of 0.33 with Cy5 as the reference and then sujected to standard deviation regularization first by pin (block) then by slide with Cy5 as the reference.  A cross file cutoff of 25% was used, so that at least 4 of the 16 slides for a given spot had to pass quality control checks.  The data from each spot on each slide were then expressed as log2-ratio, or log2(normalized Cy3/raw Cy5), which is given in the data table below.   Log2-ratios for the spots were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance using Statistical Analysis Systems version 8.02 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) to identify cDNAs that were differentially expressed on at least one of the developmental ages (n = 4; P &lt; 0.05), and a fold-change of &gt; 1.6 was used as a filter for false positives.

The two images from each slide were processed with Spotfinder version 2.2.4 (The Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, MD) using the following settings:  Otsu thresholding algorithm (minimum spot size 3 and maximum spot size 25); keep flagged values; keep raw data; and quality control filter set so 50% cutoff equals background plus 1 standard deviation.  Data were normalized using Microarray Data Analysis System (MIDAS) version 2.18 (The Institute for Genomic Research).  In MIDAS, channel A and B flags and channel A and B background checking were used, and the signal-to-noise threshold was set at 3.0.  Data from the Cy3 channel were first Lowess (LocFit) normalized by pin (block) using a smoothing parameter of 0.33 with Cy5 as the reference and then sujected to standard deviation regularization first by pin (block) then by slide with Cy5 as the reference.  A cross file cutoff of 25% was used, so that at least 4 of the 16 slides for a given spot had to pass quality control checks.  The data from each spot on each slide were then expressed as log2-ratio, or log2(normalized Cy3/raw Cy5), which is given in the data table below.

Chicken embryonic pituitary gland, embryonic day 12, replicate 2
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The two images from each slide were processed with Spotfinder version 2.2.4 (The Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, MD) using the following settings:  Otsu thresholding algorithm (minimum spot size 3 and maximum spot size 25); keep flagged values; keep raw data; and quality control filter set so 50% cutoff equals background plus 1 standard deviation.  Data were normalized using Microarray Data Analysis System (MIDAS) version 2.18 (The Institute for Genomic Research).  In MIDAS, channel A and B flags and channel A and B background checking were used, and the signal-to-noise threshold was set at 3.0.  Data from the Cy3 channel were first Lowess (LocFit) normalized by pin (block) using a smoothing parameter of 0.33 with Cy5 as the reference and then sujected to standard deviation regularization first by pin (block) then by slide with Cy5 as the reference.  A cross file cutoff of 25% was used, so that at least 4 of the 16 slides for a given spot had to pass quality control checks.  The data from each spot on each slide were then expressed as log2-ratio, or log2(normalized Cy3/raw Cy5), which is given in the data table below.   Log2-ratios for the spots were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance using Statistical Analysis Systems version 8.02 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) to identify cDNAs that were differentially expressed on at least one of the developmental ages (n = 4; P &lt; 0.05), and a fold-change of &gt; 1.6 was used as a filter for false positives.

In MIDAS, channel A and B flags and channel A and B background checking were used, and the signal-to-noise threshold was set at 3.0.  Data from the Cy3 channel were first Lowess (LocFit) normalized by pin (block) using a smoothing parameter of 0.33 with Cy5 as the reference and then sujected to standard deviation regularization first by pin (block) then by slide with Cy5 as the reference.  A cross file cutoff of 25% was used, so that at least 4 of the 16 slides for a given spot had to pass quality control checks.  The data from each spot on each slide were then expressed as log2-ratio, or log2(normalized Cy3/raw Cy5), which is given in the data table below.   Log2-ratios for the spots were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance using Statistical Analysis Systems version 8.02 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) to identify cDNAs that were differentially expressed on at least one of the developmental ages (n = 4; P &lt; 0.05), and a fold-change of &gt; 1.6 was used as a filter for false positives.

Chicken embryonic pituitary gland, embryonic day 12, replicate 4
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The two images from each slide were processed with Spotfinder version 2.2.4 (The Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, MD) using the following settings:  Otsu thresholding algorithm (minimum spot size 3 and maximum spot size 25); keep flagged values; keep raw data; and quality control filter set so 50% cutoff equals background plus 1 standard deviation.  Data were normalized using Microarray Data Analysis System (MIDAS) version 2.18 (The Institute for Genomic Research).  In MIDAS, channel A and B flags and channel A and B background checking were used, and the signal-to-noise threshold was set at 3.0.  Data from the Cy3 channel were first Lowess (LocFit) normalized by pin (block) using a smoothing parameter of 0.33 with Cy5 as the reference and then sujected to standard deviation regularization first by pin (block) then by slide with Cy5 as the reference.  A cross file cutoff of 25% was used, so that at least 4 of the 16 slides for a given spot had to pass quality control checks.  The data from each spot on each slide were then expressed as log2-ratio, or log2(normalized Cy3/raw Cy5), which is given in the data table below.   Log2-ratios for the spots were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance using Statistical Analysis Systems version 8.02 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) to identify cDNAs that were differentially expressed on at least one of the developmental ages (n = 4; P &lt; 0.05), and a fold-change of &gt; 1.6 was used as a filter for false positives.

A cross file cutoff of 25% was used, so that at least 4 of the 16 slides for a given spot had to pass quality control checks.  The data from each spot on each slide were then expressed as log2-ratio, or log2(normalized Cy3/raw Cy5), which is given in the data table below.   Log2-ratios for the spots were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance using Statistical Analysis Systems version 8.02 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) to identify cDNAs that were differentially expressed on at least one of the developmental ages (n = 4; P &lt; 0.05), and a fold-change of &gt; 1.6 was used as a filter for false positives.

Chicken embryonic pituitary gland, embryonic day 14, replicate 2
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The two images from each slide were processed with Spotfinder version 2.2.4 (The Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, MD) using the following settings:  Otsu thresholding algorithm (minimum spot size 3 and maximum spot size 25); keep flagged values; keep raw data; and quality control filter set so 50% cutoff equals background plus 1 standard deviation.  Data were normalized using Microarray Data Analysis System (MIDAS) version 2.18 (The Institute for Genomic Research).  In MIDAS, channel A and B flags and channel A and B background checking were used, and the signal-to-noise threshold was set at 3.0.  Data from the Cy3 channel were first Lowess (LocFit) normalized by pin (block) using a smoothing parameter of 0.33 with Cy5 as the reference and then sujected to standard deviation regularization first by pin (block) then by slide with Cy5 as the reference.  A cross file cutoff of 25% was used, so that at least 4 of the 16 slides for a given spot had to pass quality control checks.  The data from each spot on each slide were then expressed as log2-ratio, or log2(normalized Cy3/raw Cy5), which is given in the data table below.   Log2-ratios for the spots were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance using Statistical Analysis Systems version 8.02 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) to identify cDNAs that were differentially expressed on at least one of the developmental ages (n = 4; P &lt; 0.05), and a fold-change of &gt; 1.6 was used as a filter for false positives.

      <Label>Cy5</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
1 microgram amplified antisense RNA (equivalent to 1 microgram mRNA) from the pool was converted to cDNA using random primers with the Amino Allyl cDNA Labeling Kit (Ambion) and Cy5-monoreactive NHS esters (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) were coupled to the cDNA.  Labeled cDNA was purified from unicorporated dye using CyScribe GFX Purification Kit (Amersham Biosciences) and a pool was made of all Cy5-labeled cDNA to be split among the 16 slides in the experiment.

    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The microarray was hybridized overnight at 42 C with Cy3-labeled embryonic day 14 cDNA and an aliquot of the Cy5-labeled reference pool cDNA using microarray hybridization buffer (Amersham Biosciences).  Slides were washed in increasing stringency using salt sodium citrate.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
The microarray slides were scanned using a 418 confocal laser scanner (Affymetrix) at 550 nM for Cy3 and 649 nM for Cy5 to generate two TIFF images for each slide.
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
Chicken embryonic pituitary gland, embryonic day 14, replicate 3
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The two images from each slide were processed with Spotfinder version 2.2.4 (The Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, MD) using the following settings:  Otsu thresholding algorithm (minimum spot size 3 and maximum spot size 25); keep flagged values; keep raw data; and quality control filter set so 50% cutoff equals background plus 1 standard deviation.  Data were normalized using Microarray Data Analysis System (MIDAS) version 2.18 (The Institute for Genomic Research).  In MIDAS, channel A and B flags and channel A and B background checking were used, and the signal-to-noise threshold was set at 3.0.  Data from the Cy3 channel were first Lowess (LocFit) normalized by pin (block) using a smoothing parameter of 0.33 with Cy5 as the reference and then sujected to standard deviation regularization first by pin (block) then by slide with Cy5 as the reference.  A cross file cutoff of 25% was used, so that at least 4 of the 16 slides for a given spot had to pass quality control checks.  The data from each spot on each slide were then expressed as log2-ratio, or log2(normalized Cy3/raw Cy5), which is given in the data table below.   Log2-ratios for the spots were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance using Statistical Analysis Systems version 8.02 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) to identify cDNAs that were differentially expressed on at least one of the developmental ages (n = 4; P &lt; 0.05), and a fold-change of &gt; 1.6 was used as a filter for false positives.

Chicken embryonic pituitary gland, embryonic day 17, replicate 1
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The two images from each slide were processed with Spotfinder version 2.2.4 (The Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, MD) using the following settings:  Otsu thresholding algorithm (minimum spot size 3 and maximum spot size 25); keep flagged values; keep raw data; and quality control filter set so 50% cutoff equals background plus 1 standard deviation.  Data were normalized using Microarray Data Analysis System (MIDAS) version 2.18 (The Institute for Genomic Research).  In MIDAS, channel A and B flags and channel A and B background checking were used, and the signal-to-noise threshold was set at 3.0.  Data from the Cy3 channel were first Lowess (LocFit) normalized by pin (block) using a smoothing parameter of 0.33 with Cy5 as the reference and then sujected to standard deviation regularization first by pin (block) then by slide with Cy5 as the reference.  A cross file cutoff of 25% was used, so that at least 4 of the 16 slides for a given spot had to pass quality control checks.  The data from each spot on each slide were then expressed as log2-ratio, or log2(normalized Cy3/raw Cy5), which is given in the data table below.   Log2-ratios for the spots were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance using Statistical Analysis Systems version 8.02 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) to identify cDNAs that were differentially expressed on at least one of the developmental ages (n = 4; P &lt; 0.05), and a fold-change of &gt; 1.6 was used as a filter for false positives.

Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and was amplifed using a modification of the Eberwine Procedure (Phillips J, Eberwine JH 1996 METHODS: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology 10: 283-288). Briefly, 500 ng was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and an oligo(dT) primer containing a T7 promoter site (5'-GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATATCGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGGT24-3'; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).  Following second strand synthesis and purification, double-stranded cDNA was used as a template for in vitro transcription using the T7 MEGAscript kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and the resulting amplified antisense RNA was quantified with the Ribogreen RNA Quantitation Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

    <Data-Processing>
The two images from each slide were processed with Spotfinder version 2.2.4 (The Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, MD) using the following settings:  Otsu thresholding algorithm (minimum spot size 3 and maximum spot size 25); keep flagged values; keep raw data; and quality control filter set so 50% cutoff equals background plus 1 standard deviation.  Data were normalized using Microarray Data Analysis System (MIDAS) version 2.18 (The Institute for Genomic Research).  In MIDAS, channel A and B flags and channel A and B background checking were used, and the signal-to-noise threshold was set at 3.0.  Data from the Cy3 channel were first Lowess (LocFit) normalized by pin (block) using a smoothing parameter of 0.33 with Cy5 as the reference and then sujected to standard deviation regularization first by pin (block) then by slide with Cy5 as the reference.  A cross file cutoff of 25% was used, so that at least 4 of the 16 slides for a given spot had to pass quality control checks.  The data from each spot on each slide were then expressed as log2-ratio, or log2(normalized Cy3/raw Cy5), which is given in the data table below.   Log2-ratios for the spots were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance using Statistical Analysis Systems version 8.02 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) to identify cDNAs that were differentially expressed on at least one of the developmental ages (n = 4; P &lt; 0.05), and a fold-change of &gt; 1.6 was used as a filter for false positives.

Chicken embryonic pituitary gland, embryonic day 17, replicate 3
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The two images from each slide were processed with Spotfinder version 2.2.4 (The Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, MD) using the following settings:  Otsu thresholding algorithm (minimum spot size 3 and maximum spot size 25); keep flagged values; keep raw data; and quality control filter set so 50% cutoff equals background plus 1 standard deviation.  Data were normalized using Microarray Data Analysis System (MIDAS) version 2.18 (The Institute for Genomic Research).  In MIDAS, channel A and B flags and channel A and B background checking were used, and the signal-to-noise threshold was set at 3.0.  Data from the Cy3 channel were first Lowess (LocFit) normalized by pin (block) using a smoothing parameter of 0.33 with Cy5 as the reference and then sujected to standard deviation regularization first by pin (block) then by slide with Cy5 as the reference.  A cross file cutoff of 25% was used, so that at least 4 of the 16 slides for a given spot had to pass quality control checks.  The data from each spot on each slide were then expressed as log2-ratio, or log2(normalized Cy3/raw Cy5), which is given in the data table below.   Log2-ratios for the spots were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance using Statistical Analysis Systems version 8.02 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) to identify cDNAs that were differentially expressed on at least one of the developmental ages (n = 4; P &lt; 0.05), and a fold-change of &gt; 1.6 was used as a filter for false positives.

    <Summary>
The anterior pituitary is comprised of five major hormone-secreting cell types which differentiate during embryonic development in a  temporally distinct manner.  
Microarrays containing 5,128 unique cDNAs expressed in the neuroendocrine system were produced and used to identify genes with  potential involvement in onset of 
thyroid-stimulating hormone beta-subunit, growth hormone, and prolactin gene transcription during chick embryonic  development.  We identified 352 cDNAs that were 
differentially expressed (P &lt; 0.05 and the highest mean at least 1.6-fold greater than the lowest mean) on  embryonic day 10, 12, 14, or 17, the period of thyrotroph, 
somatotroph, and lactotroph differentiation in the chicken.  Consistent with cellular ontogeny in  the chick anterior pituitary gland, thyroid-stimulating hormone 
beta-subunit mRNA increased steadily between embryonic day 10 and embryonic day 17, growth  hormone mRNA increased between embryonic day 12 and embryonic day 17, 
and PRL mRNA did not increase until embryonic day 17.  Expression of 149 cDNAs  increased in a manner similar to thyroid-stimulating hormone beta-subunit mRNA and 
67 decreased between embryonic day 10 and embryonic day 17, and some of  these are likely associated with thyrotroph differentiation.  Similarly, expression of 74 and 66 
genes changed in a manner over the 4 ages that is consistent  with them having a potential role in induction of growth hormone and prolactin mRNA, respectively.  

Among these candidate genes are numerous transcription  factors and signaling molecules that have not previously been implicated in pituitary development.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Four biological replicates each of chicken pituitary embryonic day 10, embryonic day 12, embryonic day 14, and embryonic day 17  amplified antisense RNA were analyzed 
using neuroendocrine cDNA microarrays in a reference design.  

Each experimental sample (embryonic day 10, 12, 14, or  17) was labeled with Cy3 and hybridized with an aliquot of the Cy5 reference pool, which was generated from all 
sixteen RNA samples.
