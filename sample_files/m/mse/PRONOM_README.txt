Summary	
BWSB is a digital sound and music programming library for use in games, demos, intros, etc. All music and sound effects are played in the background, allowing your program to do anything it likes while the sound and music is playing.

BWSB uses a seamless interface to support different sound devices through the use of runtime loadable music & sound engines, so adding support for many different sound cards in your programs is no problem at all.
