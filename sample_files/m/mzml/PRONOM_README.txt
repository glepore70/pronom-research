mzML 1.1.0 Specification
History
From 2005-2008 there existed two separate XML formats for encoding raw spectrometer output: mzData developed by the PSI and mzXML developed at the Seattle Proteome Center at the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB). It was recognized that the existence of two separate formats for essentially the same thing generated confusion and required extra programming effort. Therefore the PSI, with full participation by ISB, developed a new format called mzML by taking the best aspects of each of the precursor formats to form a single one. It is intended to replace the previous two formats, which are now deprecated, although still sometimes used by older software.

On 2008-06-01, mzML 1.0.0 was released. In early 2009, several implementation efforts identified a few minor shortcomings in mzML 1.0.0. Since no vendors had yet released software supporting mzML 1.0 yet, the working group decided to release an update in June 2009. It is expected that all software will support mzML 1.1 as the long-term-stable format instead of 1.0. Below is the available documentation for mzML 1.1.0 and related information. Please send feedback to psidev-ms-dev@lists.sourceforge.net.

Status
mzML 1.1.0 was released on 2009-06-01 and has been stable every since. There were initial plans to update a new 1.2 release in 2017 to support ion mobility mass spectromy (IM-MS). However, as of 2017-11-03, it appears that support for IM-MS can be achieved without a schema change, with just some additional terms.
