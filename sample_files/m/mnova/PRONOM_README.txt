MestreNova is spectral data analyzing software, which can be run on Windows, Mac OS and whole range of Linux distributions. 

Mnova NMR processes your data (1H, 13C or any other 1D NMR as well as any 2D correlations, such as HSQC, HMBC, NOESY, COSY, TOCSY, etc.) fully automatically, whilst preserving the raw data in the background to allow more detailed processing for the expert user, with a wealth of advanced functions.
The analysis capabilities of the software are unmatched. Very advanced algorithmia enables best in class analysis of spectra (peak picking, integration, multiplet analysis, etc.) without user intervention, complemented by the ability to optimize results interactively.

The filename extension .mnova represents the MestReNova (Mnova) NMR Data (.mnova) file type and file format associated with MestReNova (Mnova), a commercial multi-platform organic chemistry analysis tool developed by Mestrelab Research. Mnova documents are saved in Mestrelab Research's internal file format by default and assigned the .mnova extension. Mnova documents that contain separate pages can be additionally saved with the .mnpag extension.

An .mnova file is a MestReNova (Mnova) document. It is a binary data file, openable in MestReNova, that contains NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectra or other source data, graphics, text, and general document's layout data. All data inside an .mnova document is retained for further processing. When openened in MestReNova, the contents of any .mnova document can be exported to PDF or a vector/bitmap image format. At the time of its installation, Mnova registers the .mnova file type in the system and sets up its own association for it, which allows to open .mnova documents in MestReNova with the default open action (double-click).
