MO3 is a file format encapsulating the features of several "MOD" formats (IT, XM, S3M, MTM, MOD, MPTM), but with one big difference: MP3 and OGG compressed samples. A lossless codec is also incorporated for any samples that don't like lossy encoding, and the whole file structure is compressed too.
All of this makes it possible to have great reductions in file sizes with practically identical sound quality. In fact, MO3 allows greater quality compositions because MP3/OGG encoding works better with 16-bit samples, so there's no reason to use low quality 8-bit samples anymore.
