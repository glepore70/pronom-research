MONOTONE
A multi-voice tracker for the PC speaker.

For those unfamiliar with trackers, a tracker is a song editor/player that lets you compose a song by entering notes and effects into a "pattern" made up of rows and columns. (Each column is called a "track", hence the name.) Patterns are then strung together by an "order list" to make a complete song.

While several PC trackers already exist, MONOTONE was designed from the ground up as a tracker for extremely simple sound devices (ie. significantly less capabilities than Adlib/Sound Blaster cards or MIDI) and platforms (ie. very old PCs, microcontrollers, etc.). Until MONOTONE, such devices have had no representation on the PC.
