This icon-based, drag-and-drop utility creates HTML, Flash and CD-ROM presentations. You can combine text, images, video, sound, Flash movies, interactivity, animation, variables and input objects. Use your own design or make use of the included templates.
Scripting support allows you to add VB and Java to your multimedia applications. You can create reusable code, custom functions and advanced interactions in the code editor. Any COM object can be accessed from your script. Mediator EXP also includes code references for both VB and Java.
You can add, size rotate and change the opacity of Flash objects, and you can communicate with any Web server worldwide. The program retrieves content from Web pages, communicates with online databases and interacts with CGI scripts.
Add ActiveX components to your applications, using any of the thousands of commercially available ActiveX objects, or create your own. Combine the script tool with ActiveX to create customized multimedia development tools.
In this version, variables can contain objects. This means that you are able to manipulate objects that are not known at design time. You can distribute your creations by Flash, HTML or CD-ROM. There is a built-in FTP upload manager, and the CD-ROM builder creates a copy of your presentation that will run on any PC.
