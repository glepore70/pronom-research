MATHCAD DOCUMENTS
.TXT 2 8 5 72 
a5,71,70,208
The MathCAD Auxiliary Disk contains many sample documents. You can 
load these documents into MathCAD to see some ways to use MathCAD's 
features.

See the file DIRECTRY.MCD for a list of these documents.
.TXT 6 -8 1 18

UNITS DOCUMENTS
.TXT 2 8 12 69 
a12,68,66,496
The MathCAD Auxiliary Disk includes three files that contain unit  
conversions.

CGS.MCD contains unit conversions in the cgs system, based on 
centimeters, grams, and seconds. All units, including electrical 
units, are defined in terms of these base units.

MKS.MCD contains unit conversions in the MKS system, based on 
meters, kilograms, seconds, and coulombs.

USCUSTOM.MCD contains unit conversions based on the U.S. Customary 
units of feet, pounds (mass), seconds, and coulombs.  
.TXT 13 0 3 65 
a3,64,62,129
You can add these conversions into files you create, or append 
them to the end of your files using the MathCAD append 
command.

PROGRAM NOTES 
=============
.TXT 3 0 1 20 
a1,19,17,18
REDISPLAY COMMAND
.TXT 2 8 21 67 
a21,66,64,841
If you suspect that the MathCAD display screen is not accurately 
reflecting the state of a document, or if equations on screen 
have gaps or overlap one another, use the redisplay command by 
pressing [Ctrl]R. This redisplays the whole screen.

Here are some actions that can cause the display to have gaps or 
unreadable parts:

    1. Regions that overlap one another on the screen.

    2. Error messages from an equation or plot that coincide     
       on screen with other regions.

    3. Cutting and pasting equations that overlap one another.

    4. Interrupting the display of a surface plot or sketch with
       [Ctrl]A or [Ctrl][Break]

None of these problems can cause computational errors; they 
affect the display only. When the information on the screen is 
unclear, press [Ctrl]R to redisplay everything.

PRINTING DOCUMENTS
.TXT 2 7 2 65 
a2,64,72,115
We recommend that you save your documents before printing, in
case of an unrecoverable printer-interface problem.
.TXT 3 0 3 64 
a3,63,72,180
If you try to print with no printer selected, MathCAD shows
you the menu of printer types. Select one and press [Enter].
Then use the print command again to print your document.
.TXT 4 0 3 68 
a3,67,65,153
If your printer works with other programs but not with MathCAD, 
MathCAD may be having difficulty communicating with your printer. 
Check the following:
.TXT 4 0 2 65 
a2,64,72,124
PARALLEL PRINTERS: Specify PRN or LPT1 as the printer device.
(Specify LPT2 if the printer is on the second parallel port.
.TXT 3 0 7 66 
a7,65,65,275
SERIAL PRINTERS: First execute the following DOS commands:

    MODE COM1: 9600,N,8,1,P           (or other parameters as 
                                      appropriate for printer)
    MODE LPT1:= COM1

Then, when MathCAD prompts for a printer device, specify PRN.
.TXT 8 0 8 69 
a8,68,72,324
PLOTTERS: First execute the following DOS command:

    MODE COM1: 9600,N,8,1,P           (see your plotter manual to
                                      make sure this is correct)

Then, when MathCAD prompts for a printer device, specify COM1. DO
NOT use LPT1 or PRN, even if you have redirected them to COM1.
   
.TXT 8 -7 1 37 
a1,36,78,35
WHAT TO DO IF MATHCAD CANNOT PRINT
.TXT 2 7 4 68 
a4,67,71,246
First, check that your printer is compatible with a model that
MathCAD supports. See the description of printing in the User's
Guide and the descriptions of each printer driver in the printed
Release Notes in the disk pocket of your package. 
.TXT 5 0 18 71 
a18,70,68,636
If MathCAD cannot print directly, try printing to a file as follows:

   1. Print the document to a file. Type [Esc] print [Enter].
   When MathCAD prompts you for a print area, press [Enter].
   Then, in place of the printer device, specify a filename like
   OUTPUT.PRN.

   2. Save your document and exit MathCAD by pressing [Ctrl]Q.

   3. At the DOS prompt, type:

               COPY /B OUTPUT.PRN PRN

   This sends the print file to the printer. Substitute the
   filename you used in step 1 for OUTPUT.PRN and the name of
   the port to which your printer is attached (for example,
   LPT1 or COM1) for PRN.  

.TXT 18 -7 1 18 
a1,17,78,16
REPLACE COMMAND
.TXT 2 7 4 67 
a4,66,64,222
MathCAD will not always recalculate equations as necessary     
after using the replace command ([Ctrl][F6]). After a replace 
command, do a process command to ensure that the calculations in 
the document are up to date.
.TXT 5 -7 1 31 
a1,30,78,29
AT & T 6300 SERIES COMPUTERS
.TXT 2 7 7 70 
a7,69,67,200
To run in high-resolution mode (640x400 color or monochrome) on an
AT&T 6300 series computer, type:

    MCAD /A

If you do not type /A, MathCAD runs in CGA-emulation mode (640x200 
monochrome).
.TXT 8 -7 1 42 
a1,41,78,40
SKETCH FILES WITH MORE THAN 8000 POINTS
.TXT 2 7 5 68 
a5,67,71,288
The program MCSTRANS.EXE, included with this disk, translates
HPGL files into MathCAD's sketch format. If the resulting sketch
has more than 8000 points, MathCAD cannot show the whole sketch
in a MathCAD document. Instead, you see a partial sketch showing
only the first 8000 points.
.TXT 6 -7 1 22 
a1,21,78,20
BLOCK CUT AND PASTE
.TXT 2 7 4 68 
a4,67,65,222
If you paste a block of regions and change your mind, just press 
[F3] to cut them again. The manual states that MathCAD will 
prompt you if the pasted regions overlap existing regions; 
actually, there is no such prompt.
.TXT 5 -7 1 20 
a1,19,78,18
COMPLEX TOLERANCE
.TXT 2 7 1 72 
a1,71,71,70
The maximum complex tolerance is 63, not 308 as stated in the manual.
