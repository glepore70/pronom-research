VGM Music Maker is a Windows based tracker for composing in Sega Genesis / Mega Drive .vgm format. It's made by Shiru, who also created TFM Music Maker. While TFM supported 6 channels of FM synthesis for the YM2612 chip, VGM Music Maker added support for the Texas Instruments SN76489, a PSG chip capable of 3 square wave channels and a noise channel, which can also produce periodic noise, as well as sample support in the 6th YM2612 channel.
