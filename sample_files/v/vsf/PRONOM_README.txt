Every VICE emulator has a built-in snapshot feature, that saves the complete emulator state into one file for later use. You can therefore save the emulator state - including the state of the game you are playing for example - in a single file.

9.1 Snapshot usage
A snapshot is one file containining the complete emulator state. A snapshot file can be generated by selecting the "Save snapshot" command at any time. This will pop up a requester from which you can specify whether the snapshot should also contain the disk and ROM status.

A snapshot file can be used to restore the emulator state by selecting the load snapshot menu entry at any time. Unfortunately attached ROM images/cartridges are only supported in the VIC20, the PET and the CBM-II emulators at this time.

The memory configuration of the emulator is saved in the snapshot file as well. This configuration is restored when the snapshot is loaded.

The VICE snapshot file starts with the magic string and includes the fileformat version number.

Type	Name	Description
