FontLab Studio 5 (VFB)
The .vfb file format is the proprietary format in FontLab Studio 5. It is fully backwards-compatible, so FontLab VI can open any .vfb file created in FontLab 3.x and 4.x, or in FontLab Studio 5. The format is also cross-platform-compatible so .vfb files saved from the Windows version can be opened in the version for Mac OS X and vice versa. In addition, the format is largely upward-compatible. This means that a .vfb file exported by FontLab VI can be opened in FontLab 3.x, 4.x or 5.x, as well as other FontLab Ltd. products such as TransType or TypeTool.

FontLab VI imports and exports .vfb. However, it does not convert Variations back to FontLab Studio Multiple Master data. As MM imported into VI is upgraded into the Variations format, this means that MM cannot be easily round-tripped from 5 to VI and then back to 5.
