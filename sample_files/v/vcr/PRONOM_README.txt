Falcon 3.0 is a combat flight simulator video game developed by Sphere Inc. and published by Spectrum HoloByte in 1991 as third official main entry in the Falcon series of the F-16 Fighting Falcon simulators.

Replay mode looks and functions exactly like a home VCR and can play back the action
from any vantage point. This mode is useful for showing dramatic combat situations, but
sometimes you may want a more tactical view of an engagement.
