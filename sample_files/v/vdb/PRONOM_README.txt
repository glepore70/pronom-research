Dr.Web is a software suite developed by Russian anti-malware company Doctor Web. First released in 1992, it became the first anti-virus service in Russia.[1]

The company also offers anti-spam solutions and is used by Yandex to scan e-mail attachments. It also features an add-on for all major browsers which checks links with the online version of Dr Web.[2]

Dr.Web has withdrawn from AV tests such as Virus Bulletin VB100% around 2008 stating that they believe that virus scans on viruses are different subject from that of real world malware attacks.
