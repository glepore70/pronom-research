Overview
The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an open-source, freely available software system for 3D computer graphics, modeling, image processing, volume rendering, scientific visualization, and 2D plotting. It supports a wide variety of visualization algorithms and advanced modeling techniques, and it takes advantage of both threaded and distributed memory parallel processing for speed and scalability, respectively.

VTK is designed to be platform agnostic. This means that it runs just about anywhere, including on Linux, Windows, and Mac; on the Web; and on mobile devices.

XML File Formats
VTK provides another set of data formats using XML syntax. While these formats are much more
complicated than the original VTK format described previously (see “Simple Legacy Formats” on
page 470), they support many more features. The major motivation for their development was to
facilitate data streaming and parallel I/O. Some features of the format include support for compression, portable binary encoding, random access, big endian and little endian byte order, multiple file
representation of piece data, and new file extensions for different VTK dataset types. XML provides
many features as well, especially the ability to extend a file format with application specific tags.

All of the VTK XML file types are well-formed XML documents.* The document-level element is
VTKFile:
<VTKFile type=”ImageData” version=”0.1” byte_order=”LittleEndian”>
...
</VTKFile>
