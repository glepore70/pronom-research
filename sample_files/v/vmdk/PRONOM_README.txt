VMDK
Extension(s)	.vmdkVMDK (Virtual Machine Disk) is a format developed by VMWare (but now open), used for storage in virtual machines (a program running on a real machine such as a desktop or laptop PC in order to simulate a separate machine for the purpose of running software in a sandboxed environment, or to use different operating systems from that of the real computer). VirtualBox can use it in addition to the VDI format. The maximum capacity is 2040 gigabytes.
