When you create and build solutions in Visual Studio, Visual Studio uses MSBuild to build each project in your solution. Every Visual Studio project includes an MSBuild project file, with a file extension that reflects the type of projectâ€”for example, a C# project (.csproj), a Visual Basic.NET project (.vbproj), or a database project (.dbproj).

When you create an app or website in Visual Studio, you start with a project. In a logical sense, a project contains all files that are compiled into an executable, library, or website. Those files can include source code, icons, images, data files, and so on. A project also contains compiler settings and other configuration files that might be needed by various services or components that your program communicates with.
