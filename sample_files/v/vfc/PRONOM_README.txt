FontLab VI format (VFC)
The VFC file format is only used in FontLab VI (and potentially by future FontLab apps). It is an extension to the FontLab Studio VFB format. You cannot install VFC files in Windows or macOS, but this format can retain all your font production elements. VFC for FontLab is like PSD for Adobe Photoshop. It is binary and optimized for fast reading and writing by the computer, to make working with it very quick.

The format is cross-platform-compatible so VFC files saved from the Windows version can be opened in the Mac version and vice versa. In addition, the format is designed with the potential to be largely upward (future) compatible.
