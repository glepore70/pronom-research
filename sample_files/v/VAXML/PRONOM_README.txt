VAXML (Virtual Anatomy eXtensible Markup Language) is a simple markup-language designed to ease the file-format problems associated with the sharing of virtual specimen data. VAXML datasets use one or more STL or PLY files (either binary or ascii) to define the geometry of objects that comprise the dataset, together with one VAXML file that provides metadata on the dataset as a whole, and specifies how the STL/PLY files are to be put together. VAXML is an XML-based language.
