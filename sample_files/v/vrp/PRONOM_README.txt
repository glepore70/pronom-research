VX-REXX is a highly extensible REXX GUI development system for OS/2 developed by Watcom and initially released in 1993.

Much of the new code in eComStation and ArcaOS has been written using VX-REXX.[1]

Though REXX is itself a 3GL, the VX-REXX interface allows you to build REXX programs using a combination of 3GL and 4GL techniques; its drag-and-drop interface to inserting code allows quite complex programs to be built without actually entering any code.

Normally, saving a VX-REXX a project generates three files: xxxx.VRX (ASCII file containing the REXX function source), xxxx.VRY (binary file containing the window resources) and xxxx.VRP (ASCII file containing the project definition and metadata) â€“ if you have additional code files, these are also saved as whatever.VRX.
