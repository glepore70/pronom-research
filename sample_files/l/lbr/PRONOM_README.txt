  There are two different types of LBR files, one for the C64 and one  more
commonly used by CP/M (in this case on the  C128).  This  explanation  only
deals with the C64 type.

  This is a native C64 format, slightly similar in  structure  to  ARK/LNX.
There exists a program on the C64 called  "Library  10.0"  which  seems  to
maintain these containers. From the information in the  program  (which  is
written in BASIC with a small ML subroutine), it appears  the  program  was
really meant for up/downloading files from BBS's.  From  looking  over  the
text in Library V7.0, the author appears to be Mike Swanson,  or  at  least
the author of that version.
