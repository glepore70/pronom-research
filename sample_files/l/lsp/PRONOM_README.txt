AutoCAD PROTECTED LISP file

It just means that the author wanted to maintain a little privacy about
the specific content of his work. Lisp files (thru R14.01) are commonly
protected with a little executable originally shipped with AutoCAD in the
'80's, called PROTECT.EXE. There's even a little companion routine,
KELV.EXE that converts all of the symbols into gibberish for an added
level of protection. Since the advent of Visual LISP, most authors who
wish to protect their code just compile it to .vlx or .arx format.
