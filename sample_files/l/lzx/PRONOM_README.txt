LZX is both a compression algorithm (of the Lempel-Ziv family) and an archiving program (and file format). The archiving program and compression algorithm were both created by Jonathan Forbes and Tomi Poutanen in Canada, and the archiver was released for the Amiga computer in both shareware and registered versions. When the authors ended support for the program in 1997, they released a key for the registered version so that anybody could use it free.
