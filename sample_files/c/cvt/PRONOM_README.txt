Convert is an archiving format associated with the Convert utility included with some versions of the GEOS OS. GEOS "files" are not ordinary files, so Convert and similar formats are sometimes used to transfer them to other platforms.

Convert is platform-specific, and different GEOS platforms use different versions of it.
