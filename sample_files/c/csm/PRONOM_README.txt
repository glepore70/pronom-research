CSM
character studio Marker format (. csm). This is an ASCII (text) format that uses positional markers rather than limb rotation data.

When you import a raw marker file, the positional data is stored in the motion-capture buffer. 3ds Max then uses the marker data to position a biped by calculating limb-rotation data.

Note: For the CSM file specification, see the csm.rtf document on the 3ds Max disc. This file is in the folder \samples\motion\docs.
