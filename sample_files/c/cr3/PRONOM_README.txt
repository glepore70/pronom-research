NOTE: THIS FORMAT CONFLICTS WITH EXISTING FMT/199. 


Canonâ€™s new CR3 file which will appear with the EOS M50 Mirrorless Camera: https://www.canonwatch.com/canon-eos-m50-specifications-image-leaked-introduces-new-raw-file-format-viewfinder/ 276

I have carried out a preliminary investigation, located sample images and made positive progress. The file is written as ISO BMFF which is well documented and for which I have found code to search/dump the structure of the file.
