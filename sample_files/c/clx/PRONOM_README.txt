Most or all words reported as misspellings
Applies to: All versions

Problem: When checking text, WSpell reports all or most words as misspellings.

Discussion: The main American and UK English dictionaries are shipped as two files: SSCEAM.TLX (or SSCEBR.TLX) and SSCEAM2.CLX (or SSCEBR2.CLX). The first file contains about 1,000 of the most commonly used words in English. The second file contains about 100,000 of the most commonly used words. Words in the first file are also present in the second file.
