CIF2 is a new, alternative file format for use with the Crystallographic Information Framework, supplementing the original CIF format ('CIF1') developed in the early 1990s.

The CIF2 standard is described in a recent publication:  Bernstein, H. J., Bollinger, J. C., Brown, I. D., Gra≈æulis, S., Hester, J. R., McMahon, B., Spadaccini, N., Westbrook, J. D. & Westrip, S. P.
