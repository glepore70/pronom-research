CadStd (CAD Standard) is a CAD program by Apperson & Daughters, available in free and premium versions. It will export data in a number of formats, including DXF, SVG, and HP-GL, but has a native format with a .cad extension.

Files appear to begin with the bytes 43 41 44 53 54 44 (hex), which spells "CADSTD" in ASCII.
