Robotic Interface
This option creates a “flat ASCII file” containing the entire pallet load information and the XYZ coordinates of the cases. This
data can then be transferred, via an external interface, to the PLC of the robotic palletizer.
Select this option and you will be prompted with the following screen.
Provide a file name and path and the program will save the CAPE Robotic Interface file and send it to your chosen
directory. The file extension is .CRF.
