Electronic WorkBench (EWB) is a simulation package for electronic circuits. It allows you to design and analyze circuits without using breadboards, real components or actual instruments. EWB's click-and-drag operations make editing a circuit fast and easy. You can change parameters and circuit components on the fly, which make "what-if" analysis straight foreward.�

 

This tutorial is intended as a quick introduction to EWB's basic features. It first leads you through the fundamental steps of putting a circuit together and analyzing its function using the instruments. The final part of the tutorial consists of two exercises that try to illustrate the power of EWB. It also tries to encourage you to apply the "what if" approach to circuit design. It will greatly help your understanding of electronics if you use EWB in an interactive manner: Make change to the circuits you are working on, observe the effects that these changes have, and try to understand them. EWB puts very little constraints on parameters so do not be too timid, don't just change things by 10%, try out what happens when you change them by a couple of orders in magnitude.

 

Directly printing EWB schematics and graphs does usually not produce satisfactory result, and leads to a tremendous waste of paper.� It is better to incorporate EWB results by copying them to the clipboard using the copy as bitmap command, and then pasting this into a something like a word document.

To open EWB click on its icon. Initially you will see an empty circuit window and two toolbars, the circuit toolbar with the common file management, editing and graphics tools, and a Parts Bin toolbar from which you can select a wide range of circuit elements, and instruments. The following will guide you on your first attempt to simulate circuits.
