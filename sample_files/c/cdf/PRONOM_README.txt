What is Common Data Format (CDF)?
Self-describing data format for the storage of scalar and multidimensional data in a platform- and discipline-independent way
Scientific data management package (CDF Library) allows application developers to manage these data arrays
Transparent access to data and meta-data through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
Built-in support for data compression (gZip, RLE, Huffman) and automatic data uncompression, and checksum
Large file support (> 2G-bytes)
CDF library includes a suite of tools that allow users to manipulate CDF files
Provide read/write interfaces for C, FORTRAN, Java, Perl, C#/Visual Basic, IDL, MATLAB (and user-supplied software, e.g., Python, Sybase, mySQL)
