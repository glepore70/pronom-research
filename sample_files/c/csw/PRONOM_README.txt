CSW files are a way of storing sample data in a compact form, typically taking 1/10th of an ordinary VOC. It is used internally by MakeTZX, but it is also very useful to keep down the disk space taken by your VOC/WAV files. The CSW utility can handle CSW conversion in both ways (see below). Of course, MakeTZX itself accepts CSW files for input. When converting to the CSW format, the sample file is processed through MakeTZX's internal digital filter which reduces noise and signal distortions very efficiently. Make a backup copy of the original file if you will need the original samples later, but remeber that in most cases the CSW will be a lot better than the original file. Note that CSWs are intended for use with square waves only (such as computer tapes)! The compression ratio depends on many factors; in general, the higher the sample rate, the higher the ratio. A clean and regular signal helps too. The ratio for a 44 KHz file will usually be twice the value for a 22 KHz one. The typical gain for a 44 KHz turbo tape is about 93%, which means a 12:1 compression factor! Normal speed tapes should compress even better. Finally, CSW files are highly compressable with the standard PC archivers such as RAR and ZIP. The packed CSW files are usually smaller than the zipped original VOCs. You will be able to RAR a 40 MB sample file down to a few hundreds KB.
