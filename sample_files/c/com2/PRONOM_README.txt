P-Screen COM Screen is a character graphics format native to P-Screen, a DOS utility developed by Rob W. Smetana and Pro-Formance. It is a self-displaying COM file. The format was introduced in P-Screen v3.1.

It is notable for its similarity to TheDraw COM File. But it is a different format, not compatible with any known version of TheDraw COM File.

As of v5.5, the freely-distributable version of P-Screen can read the format, but does not support writing it.

Identification
Known files have ASCII text at offset 9 that begins "Pro~Formance Screen Design".
