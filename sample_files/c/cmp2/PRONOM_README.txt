Mathcad is computer software for the verification, validation, documentation and re-use of mathematical calculations in engineering and science, notably mechanical, chemical, electrical, and civil engineering.[2] Released in 1986 on DOS, it introduced live editing (WYSIWYG) of typeset mathematical notation in an interactive notebook, combined with automatic computations. It was originally developed by Mathsoft, and since 2006 has been a product of Parametric Technology Corporation.

A colormap is a .CMP file containing three columns of values that represent levels of
red, green, and blue. You can apply a colormap to a 3D plot as described in “Fill Color”
on page 236. Each value in a colormap should be an integer between 0 and 255,
inclusive. By default Mathcad saves and loads colormaps from the CMAPS subfolder
of the location where you installed Mathcad.
