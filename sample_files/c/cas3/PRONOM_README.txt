The Colour Genie EG 2000 was one of these small, first home-computers
with color (or colour ;-) in the early eighties (I think it was 1982).
This Emulator is capable of running nearly every software that was
designed for the Colour Genies Z80 microprocessor and special hardware.
It does this by emulating the Zilog Z80 CPU instruction set (which
has several thousand different opcodes, compared to the Rockwell 6502
with less than 256 opcodes). Furthermore the emulator manages each
read and write from and to memory via function pointer tables.
For each address there can be a different handling, before
and/or after reading from or writing to it.

The EACA EG2000 Colour Genie was a computer produced by Hong Kong-based manufacturer EACA and introduced in Germany in August 1982. The company went bankrupt when its founder left it with a suitcase of money. TCS in Germany St, Augustin, near Bonn went bankrupt later. It followed their earlier Video Genie I and II computers and was released around the same time as the business-oriented Video Genie. The BASIC was compatible with the Video Genie I and II and the TRS-80, except for graphic and sound commands; most of the routines for Video Genie I BASIC commands were left over in the Colour Genie's BASIC ROM. Programs were provided to load TRS-80 programs into the Colour Genie. Colour Genie disks could be read in a TRS-80 floppy disk drive and vice versa, editing the pdrive commands.

The original Video Genies had been based upon (and broadly compatible with) the then-current TRS-80 Model I. As the Colour Genie was descended from this architecture, it was incompatible with Tandy's newer TRS-80 Color Computer which - despite its name - was an entirely new and unrelated design based on an entirely different CPU, and thus incompatible with the TRS-80 Model I and derivatives such as the Color Genie.
