Compressed Hunks of Data Manager
Introduction
A (C)ompressed (H)unks of (D)ata file or CHD for short is a standard format developed by the MAME project for storing hunks of data.

The format was originally developed to image later 200x arcade machines that had begun shipping with internal hard drives. Beyond that some arcade hardware systems also began shipping with interchangeable discs (e.g. NAOMI) and a format was also needed to capture these.
