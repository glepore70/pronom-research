The CPL file extension is associated with CorelDRAW, a vector editor created and sold by the Canadian Corel Corporation headquartered in Ottawa. The latest version of the program (X6) was released in March 2012 and runs only on Microsoft Windows.

The CPL file format is proprietary (there is no CPL file format specification publicly available) and it's used by Corel as the default for saving color palettes. Corel comes with a wide range of color palettes which can be selected from the Color Palette Browser.

Users can also create and customize new color palettes and store them locally in CPL files. Corel offers a wide variety of customization options when creating new color palettes.
