Exporting Vault Settings
Most administrative settings/tools have an export function that lets you export settings from a vault to make them available in other vaults or for testing.

For example, if you create a column set in one vault, you can export it to a file that can be imported into another vault.

Settings are exported as .cex files.

You can export all the settings for an object, or select a specific setting and export it. For example, you can export all column sets, or export a specific column set.
