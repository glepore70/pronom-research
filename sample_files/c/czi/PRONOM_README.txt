A CZI file is a microscope image data file created in the Carl Zeiss CZI format. It contains image stacks, time-lapse series, and tile images captured from a Carl Zeiss microscope. CZI files are used for generating video sequences and performing medical research.

More Information
CZI files can be analyzed and visualized with Carl Zeiss' ZEN software. There is also a Java API called ZeissCZIReader that can be used for programmatically reading the contents of CZI files. ZeissCZIReader is part of Fiji, which is incorporated into the ImageJ image processing software.
