KiSS CEL is a raster image file format associated with Kisekae Set System, a game(?) that involves making computerized "paper" dolls. Much of the information about it is in Japanese.

Its name has many variations. "KiSS" may instead be "KIS" or "KiSS/GS" (GS is the name of the specification), "CEL" may instead be "cell", and the words may be capitalized in any conceivable way.

The original KiSS graphics format uses two files for each image: a .CEL file containing the bitmap, and a (possibly shared) .KCF file containing the color palette. KCF files are also known as KiSS color files.
