Star Wars: Jedi Knight is a first-person shooter and third-person shooter video game series set in the fictional Star Wars expanded universe. The series focuses primarily on Kyle Katarn, a former Imperial officer who becomes a mercenary working for the Rebel Alliance, and later a Jedi and instructor at Luke Skywalker's Jedi Academy. While the first game is set a year after the events of A New Hope, the sequels take place in the decade following Return of the Jedi.

The Jedi Knight series began in 1995 with the release of Star Wars: Dark Forces for DOS, Macintosh, and PlayStation. This was followed in 1997 by Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II for Microsoft Windows, in which Katarn learns the ways of a Jedi. In 1998, Star Wars Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith was released as an expansion pack for Dark Forces II, this time giving the player control of Mara Jade as well as Katarn. In 2002, Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast was released. Jedi Outcast was developed by Raven Software and powered by the id Tech 3 game engine. It was released for Windows, Mac, Xbox and GameCube. Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy followed in 2003 on Windows, Mac and Xbox. It was powered by the same game engine as its predecessor. Jedi Academy was the first game in the series where the player does not control Katarn at any point, although he is featured prominently in the storyline.

The games in the Jedi Knight series have received generally favorable reviews. Multiple publications have commented on the quality of the series as a whole. The use of the lightsaber in the series, a prominent gameplay element in all but the first game, has received specific praise for its implementation.

Cog Files
Please Note: Due to the amount of time it is taking to do the cog specs,we decided to release the specs before ,they are completed. So you will find somethings still blank and pieces missing here and there.There is quite abit of information available as they are however. We will try to have this section completed when we release the next version of specs 0.3.

PS: Please remember this is not meant to be a cog tutor. We`ll leave that for somebody else to write.
Thanks

Cog Files General
Cog Files control/manipulate many aspects in Jedi Knight, some uses are weapons,force powers,animations,sound playing,doors elevators etc.

Cog files are written in a language specific to Jedi Knight. It is somewhat similar to "C".

There are a few conventions through out cog files.

First off is "comment markers".

"#"  This marker can be placed anywhere in the cog file, any characters following it on that line will be ignored by the game
"//" These markers only appear in the code , they have the same function as above
Example 1: # Jedi Knight Cog Script
