The Sims is a series of life simulation video games developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts. The franchise has sold nearly 200 million copies worldwide, and it is one of the best-selling video game series of all time.[1]

The games in the Sims series are largely sandbox games, in that they lack any defined goals (except for some later expansion packs and console versions which introduced this gameplay style). The player creates virtual people called "Sims," places them in houses, and helps direct their moods and satisfy their desires. Players can either place their Sims in pre-constructed homes or build them themselves. Each successive expansion pack and game in the series augmented what the player could do with their Sims.

The Sims series is part of the larger Sim series, started by SimCity in 1989.

The CMX files
These files are probably one of the most important files in the game. With CMX files the game decides what your Sims will look like, how they will interact with each other and what animation will be used when the Sim is making his moves. Scope of this guide is giving directions in manipulating CMX files (and SKN files) to change your Sims look.

For instance if the CMX file B001FAFit_01.cmx is opened you will see something like this:
