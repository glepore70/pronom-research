What is a CSF file?
A CSF file is a color management settings file used by Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator. It contains policies for color images, such as web graphic color definitions, ColorSync colors, prepress colors for different countries, and other color settings. CSF files are used for achieving color consistency between images and prints.

More Information
NOTE: CSF files can be shared between Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator. They may also be managed using the Adobe Bridge application.

Adobe CS color settings file
The .csf file is used by all Adobe Creative Suite applications and defines the settings for CMYK, RGB and grayscale images. If this color setting is used to convert your images to CMYK, the ink density will be correct and dot gain will be better compensated for.

To install the WBJ newsprint .csf file:

Macintosh users: Download the .csf file and place it in this folder: User > Library > Application Support > Adobe > Color > Settings. Open Bridge and from the Edit menu, select "Creative Suite Color Settings ..." From the list choose "WBJ newsprint color profile" and click Apply.

PC users: Consult the Adobe CS documentation for the correct place to store color settings files.

Saving and Loading Color Settings
One of the things that drives my students crazy is when a color in Adobe InDesign looks different when displayed in Adobe Illustrator or Adobe Photoshop. Fortunately, it is easy to synchronize your Adobe application color settings so the color looks the same.

To save the color settings:
Set your color settings as described in the previous section.
Click the Save button in the Color Settings dialog box.
Name the color settings file (.csf) and save it in the following location ￼:
Disk: Users: [User]: Library: Application Support: Adobe: Color: Settings (Mac).
Disk: Documents and Settings: [User]: Application Data: Adobe: Color: Settings (Win).
