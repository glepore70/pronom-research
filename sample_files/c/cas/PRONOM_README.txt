CAS is a binary file format originally introduced by Ernest R. Schreurs' as the output format of his WAV2CAS utility. It is intended to store Atari tapes efficiently.

Originally, CAS format could not store non-standard signals that are common on tapes with copy-protection measures. In A8CAS, the file format has been extended to support those tapes, and also to support tapes in turbo formats. The extension is backwards-compatible - that is, all "old" CAS files are readable by liba8cas.
