Quest Versions 1-4, often referred to as just Quest, is an Interactive Fiction authoring system. It was first released sometime around 1999 or 2000 and stopped being released in 2012.

Quest was originally released ca. 1999 or 2000 by "Axe Software"[1] (apparently a single person, "Alex Warren"). Quest appears to have, from the start, had a "free" version and a paid "pro" version (containing the "QDK", the "Quest Development Kit"); the "free" version was to have been able to play games, but edit them with limited capacity, a practice varying intensity, over versions, from including "nag screens"[2] to putting fundamental limits on the editor's abilies[3].

In 2011, in anticipation of the release of Quest 5, Quest 4 was made entirely free of cost.[4]
