The CellML language is an open standard based on the XML markup language. CellML is being developed by the Auckland Bioengineering Institute at the University of Auckland and affiliated research groups.

The purpose of CellML is to store and exchange computer-based mathematical models. CellML allows scientists to share models even if they are using different modelling tools. It also enables them to reuse components from one model in another, thus accelerating model development.
