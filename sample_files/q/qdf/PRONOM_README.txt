Quill
Quill is the first wordprocessor package written by Psion and packaged with the Sinclair QL home computer. The US version of the software is simply called 'Word Processor'

Quill uses the same friendly menu driven interface familiar to users of the other Psion business programs, Abacus, Archive and Easel and you could import data between all four programs.

Written at the time when dot matrix printers were just beginning to emerge, Quill only offers a limited range of fonts and styles, although more could be added through the printer translates program. As a result, its output now looks dated compared to modern word processors, although it still remains very popular, due to its simplicity and ease of use.

Quill was developed originally on a VAX mainframe in 1983 in C by Martin Stamp. Tested on some of the in-house 'rack-based' development versions of the QL, the software had to be reduced in size using a 'table-language' developed by Psion, in order to ensure that the programs could fit within the QL's memory and microdrive cartridges.

In common with the other Psion business programs, the main problem with Quill was that it grabs all of the QL's available memory, thus making it difficult to multi-task with the other programs (even on expanded systems). This was resolved by programs such as CHOice and QL Switch.

Quill was also included as part of the Xchange package.

Work on the four Psion office packages Quill, Archive, Abacus and Easel started about 18 months prior to the QL's launch in January 1984. Originally developed on a VAX minicomputer, discussions began between Psion and Sinclair Research about developing it for the QL. The software was therefore developed in a way which allowed it to be ported to various machines and processors (eventually it was released for the Sinclair QL, the IBM PC, Graduate, ICL One Per Desk, Merline Tonto, Apricot and Sirius computers).

1. INTRODUCTION TO QUILL
QUILL is a sophisticated word processor. It has been designed to give you the maximum in power and
flexibility, while still being easy to learn and use. As you will see later, you are always kept informed as
to what you can do next and how to do it.
You can use a word processor in any circumstance where you would otherwise use a typewriter. The
two machines are very similar in function, although the word processor has many advantages that are
not matched by a conventional typewriter. The most obvious difference is the ease with which mistakes
can be corrected. Since the text is not printed as you type it in, you can make any corrections you wish.
You need only print your text when you are sure that it is exactly what you want.
Working through this section of the XCHANGE manual you will see that there are many other
advantages. For example, when using a typewriter it is necessary to press the carriage return key at the
end of every line. In QUILL, this function is performed automatically. Whenever the printed text
reaches the end of a line, a new line is started; you press ENTER only when you want to start a new
paragraph. Whenever a new line is started you will notice that the spacing of the text in the last line will
be adjusted so that the left and right margins are lined up throughout the text. This process, which is
known as justification, gives a highly professional appearance to the final result, without any effort on
your part. Like most of the features of QUILL, the form of justification that you use can be modified,
depending on your requirements.
The best way to learn about QUILL is to use it. If you are not sure about something, try a simple
example so that you can see how it works.
