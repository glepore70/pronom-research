QTIF (QuickTime Image Format) is a now-deprecated container format for still images from a QuickTime video. It consists of a description section and an image data section. The image data may be of various formats, including JPEG. The "native" parts of this format use big-endian byte order, though the image data part may use a different endianness depending on that format's standards.
