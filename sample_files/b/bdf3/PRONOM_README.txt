BioSemi's goal is to provide the scientific community with state-of-the-art instrumentation for electro physiology research. Using the latest available technology and offering maximum freedom of configuration and flexibility to integrate our hard- and software in your laboratory setup are the key principles in our designs. Our products are specifically designed to be used in research applications only. They are optimized for this specific application by offering features like: freely configurable hardware and completely open-source software, BioSemi does not develop or produce products for medical applications.


Which file format does BioSemi use ?
 
For the new ActiveTwo system, we use the BioSemi Data Format. BDF is a 24 bit version of the popular 16 bit EDF format, which was used on previous BioSemi models with 16 bit converters. BDF is almost the same as EDF (see the full specifications and differences of the BDF/EDF file formats in the 2 tables below. Although initially the EDF format was mainly used in sleep research, BDF/EDF is now quickly gaining popularity in other EEG applications, ECG body surface potential mapping as well as EMG.
BESA, Sourcesignal and Persyst are fully compatible with BDF.
 
The EDF format was designed and published in 1992 by Bob Kemp, Alpo VÃ¤rri, Agostinho C. Rosa, Kim D. Nielsen and John Gade as "A simple format for exchange of digitized polygraphic recordings" in Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology, 82 (1992) 391-393. The original EDF specifications can be found here
 
Each BDF/EDF file starts with a header followed by the number of Data records indicated in the header.
 
The last channel of a BDF file is always the Trigger Status channel.
