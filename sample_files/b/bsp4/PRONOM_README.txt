The SPK format is used by SPICELIB, a FORTRAN library that
is part of the software package called NAIF also supplied by JPL.
NAIF, given ephemeris data, can perform many different types of
calculations for the object of the ephemeris data. One such
calculation is the position and velocity of the target body
relative to another body.
