Jeskola Buzz is a freeware modular music studio for Windows. The native song file format for Jeskola Buzz is .bmx files, which contain a machine layout, patterns, sequences and samples associated with a song. Files with the .bmw extension are in the same format, but do not contain embedded samples.

In addition to the native file formats, Buzz can accept samples in the form of WAV files and instruments in Extended instrument (.xi) format. It can output audio in 16 or 32-bit WAV.

Due to the modular nature of Buzz, it is relatively easy for others to develop "machines" - these can be generators or effects e.g. a synthesiser, an echo effect, etc. Buzz machines have the file extension .dll. Buzz also supports the use of VST plugins.
