Datasets (2)
Every time you open a database, or execute a search on a previously opened database, a dataset is created. Datasets represent temporary subsets of games in the database. As such, datasets contain only pointers to games within the database, rather than the games themselves. While this may not mean much to the casual user, it does make many operations faster to perform.	
When CA was first developed, datasets were used as a very fast means of working with games, and you could perform logical operations on them. CA still maintains backward compatibility with these earlier functions, but they can be complicated to use when the contents of a database is updated frequently. This gave rise (In version 6) to the creation of classifiers; more on this later.

One very important thing to know about datasets, is that any time you want to perform an operation on more than one game at a time (for instance printing a game collection, or checking multiple games for blunders), you need to first create a dataset that contains the games you want to process.
