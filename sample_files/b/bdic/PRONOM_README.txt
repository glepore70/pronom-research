Release of the Google Chrome software program prompted the development of the Chrome Dictionary File file type by Google. Website visitor analysis indicates that BDIC files are commonly found on Windows 10 user machines, and are most popular in United States. A high percentage of these users browse the web using Google Chrome.

Chromium actually reads an optimized format which uses the suffix .bdic. This file is generated from the .aff, .dic, and .dic_delta files using the convert_dict tool in the Chromium project. All of these files are checked into deps/third_party/hunspell_dictionaries/ in Subversion, and checked out into src/third_party/hunspell_dictionaries when syncing locally.
