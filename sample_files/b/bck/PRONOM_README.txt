Eracha is a platform game in which you play a caveman. You go around killing ghosts and other creatures to get to the end of each level. You have a club to kill the monsters and you can also pick up different weapons you can throw.

The controls are very easy. You use the cursor keys to move, up to jump, control to use your club, alt to throw an item and space to switch through your throwing items. There are eight levels to play in total.
