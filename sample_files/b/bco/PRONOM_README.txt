Bitstream Inc.

No matter what typeface format you

need, Bitstream, the first all-digi-

tal type foundry, can probably
supply it. The Bitstream Typeface Library
offers 207 well-drawn typefaces in the
company’s own Speedo format, which
ship in 52 $129 typeface packages with
about four typefaces each, and in six $199
typeface collections, which have 12 faces
each. By the end of this year, all of
Bitstream’s 1,100 typefaces should be
available in new packages containing fonts
in Speedo and Type | formats. Finally, as
soon as Bitstream can test the shipping
version of Microsoft Windows 3.1, you
will be able to get the same designs in
TrueType versions.

If you cannot wait for the Type 1 or
TrueType library, and you use an applica-
tion that doesn’t support Speedo, you can
still use Bitstream’s first 207 faces. All 52
typeface packages contain, in addition to
Speedo, the older .BCO format, which
you can convert with Bitstream’s Fontware
utility into unhinted scalable outlines for
your HP LaserJet III or to bitmaps for any
HP LaserJet. The scalable HP LaserJet IIT
fonts don’t perform well at small sizes but
are adequate for most text and display
purposes. The typeface packages also
contain a .BEZ format, which Fontware
can convert into unhinted PostScript out-
lines, or into hinted outlines compatible
with the Pacific Page PostScript emula-
tion cartridges and a few other PostScript-
language clones, but not with Adobe’s
PostScript.
