An Emerging Industry Standard for Linking Genomic Sequences to Biological Function

Extensible Markup Languages describe data in a way that captures the semantics of encoded information, allowing more efficient access to information. BSML is an extensible language specification and container for bioinformatic data.

BSML encodes biological sequence information and includes graphical representations of biologically meaningful objects such as sequences, genes, electrophoresis gels, and multiple alignments.

BSML was initially developed to solve the problem of data representation for biological sequences. Its creation coincided with both an increase in the number of international sequence databases, and the sophistication of computational methods for sequence analysis. The early objectives for BSML included creating a data representation model that would enable graphical rendering of biologically meaningful objects and connect these visual objects to underlying data (i.e., to link the behavior of the display object to the sequences, annotations, and links it represents). Although it is possible to use BSML strictly for data encoding, the additional features of visualization and linking have paralleled the evolution of storage, analysis, and linking of biological data on computer networks. The underlying structure of BSML is therefore an excellent platform for dealing with the critical issues of post-genomic bioinformatics. BSML permits the representation and interconnection of sequence information at many levels of complexity, from genomic sequence through gene product and the description of phenotypical characteristics.

BSML is a comprehensive data model for sequences and their annotations. It differs from other biosequence markup languages in its logical completeness, as exemplified by descriptors for both the physical-chemical attributes of sequences as well as the abstract annotations. Because BSML encodes the semantics of the data it represents, it can serve both human interaction with sequences and annotations as well as machine processing of sequence data. This is critical for interoperability when building automated systems of analysis in which, for example, robots and synthesis machines may be instructed to create molecules with specific properties. BSML can be used to describe sequence-related phenomena at all levels, from the biomolecular level to the level of the complete organism, and thus it provides an excellent medium for genomics research.

BSML supports the software implementation of genetic metaphors (linear and circular maps, annotations, locations, etc), familiar to any biologists with a basic knowledge of molecular biology. BSML brings genomics to the desktop of the biologist who is not a computer specialist.
