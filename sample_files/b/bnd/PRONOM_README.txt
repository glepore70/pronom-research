Epi Map is a program for IBM-compatible microcomputers that produces and displays maps from geographic boundary files and data values entered from the keyboard or supplied in Epi Info or dBASE files. The data may be counts, rates, or other numeric values. In Color/Pattern maps, the values are represented as shading or color patterns for each geographic entity. In Dot Density maps, randomly placed dots proportional in number to the values are placed in each entity. Epi Map also produces Cartograms, in which the value for each geographic entity is allowed to control the size of the entity. Thus, a state or country will be small on the map if the value being represented (e.g., cases of AIDS) is small, but large if the number is large.

Epi Map is a module that displays geographic maps with data from Epi Info. Epi Map is built around the Esri MapObjects software. Epi Map displays shapefiles containing the geographic boundaries layered with data results from the Analysis module.

Epi Map is designed to show data from Epi Info 2000 files by relating data fields to SHAPE files containing the geographic boundaries. Shapefiles
