ImageLab images are used in image software packaged with BioRad biomedical imaging hardware (from the same company responsible for the BioRad confocal image). There's apparently also something called PrintTechnic (some sort of image scanner?) that's similar or related; various lists of formats supported by other products includes the two with a slash just as in this article title. Online documentation is a bit scanty.
