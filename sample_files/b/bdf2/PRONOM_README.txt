Adobe has defined a file format for distributing bitmap fonts called BDF. MicroSoft extended this format to support greymap (anti-aliased, each pixel representing various levels of grey rather than just black/white) fonts. Recently others have started using this same format (gbdfed, freetype and fontforge).
