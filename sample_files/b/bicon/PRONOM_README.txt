The “native” Houdini icons are .icon files that used to be used on SGI machines. It's a vector format. The .bicon is the binary version. You can, however, use regular .jpgs for your icons (and pretty much any other image format Houdini supports). For more info on making .icon files have a look here:

Take care,
