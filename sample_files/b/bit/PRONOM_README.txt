Xilinx, Inc. (/ˈzaɪlɪŋks/ ZY-links) was an American technology and semiconductor company that primarily supplied programmable logic devices. The company was known for inventing the first commercially viable field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and creating the first fabless manufacturing model.[4][5][6]

Xilinx was co-founded by Ross Freeman, Bernard Vonderschmitt, and James V Barnett II in 1984 and the company went public on the NASDAQ in 1989.[7][8][citation needed] AMD announced its acquisition of Xilinx in October 2020 and the deal was completed on February 14, 2022 through an all-stock transaction worth an estimated $50 billion.[9][10]

Q. Tell me about the format of the .BIT files please
A. Sure.
The Xilinx .bit format is pretty simple.  It uses keys and lengths to
divide the file.
Here is an example.  Below is a hex dump from the beginning of a .bit file:

00000000:  00 09 0f f0 0f f0 0f f0 0f f0 00 00 01 61 00 0a  *.............a..*
00000010:  78 66 6f 72 6d 2e 6e 63 64 00 62 00 0c 76 31 30  *xform.ncd.b..v10*
00000020:  30 30 65 66 67 38 36 30 00 63 00 0b 32 30 30 31  *00efg860.c..2001*
00000030:  2f 30 38 2f 31 30 00 64 00 09 30 36 3a 35 35 3a  */08/10.d..06:55:*
00000040:  30 34 00 65 00 0c 28 18 ff ff ff ff aa 99 55 66  *04.e..(.......Uf*

Field 1
2 bytes          length 0x0009           (big endian)
9 bytes          some sort of header

Field 2
2 bytes          length 0x0001
1 byte           key 0x61                (The letter "a")
