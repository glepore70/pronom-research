File Header


As far as I know all BSP files are stored in a little-endian (Intel) byte order and converted as loaded when used on a big-ending platform. This allows the same map files to be shared by Quake clients running on all different platforms. If you're going to be loading BSP files on a big-endian machine -- like a Macintosh or UNIX machine -- you're going to have to be careful about swapping the byte order.

The Quake BSP file format is organized around a directory structure, where all of the data is contained in "free floating" lumps within the file. There's a directory in the beginning of the file which tells the offset of the start of the lump and the length. This directory comes after the first 8 bytes of the file is a table of contents which gives the location and length of these lumps.

The format for the BSP file header is the bsp_header structure shown below:


struct bsp_lump
{

    uint32    offset;     // offset (in bytes) of the data from the beginning of the file
    uint32    length;     // length (in bytes) of the data

};

struct bsp_header
{

    uint32    magic;      // magic number ("IBSP")
    uint32    version;    // version of the BSP format (38)

Description	[top]

File structure

Quake 3 BSP files are IBSP files, and therefore have a structure similar to previous BSP files from id Software. Every IBSP file begins with a header, which in turn contains a lump directory. The lump directory describes the layout of the rest of the file, which contains some number of lumps. Each lump stores a particular kind of map data.


Header / Directory
Lump

...
The layout of an IBSP file. An IBSP file consists of a header followed by a number of lumps. The header contains a directory which identifies the locations and sizes of the lumps.
Data types

Quake 3 BSP files contains only four basic data types. They are:

Type	Description
ubyte	unsigned byte
int	4-byte integer, little-endian
float	4-byte IEEE float, little-endian
string[n]	string of n ASCII bytes, not necessarily null-terminated
All data in a BSP file is organized into records composed of these four data types.

Header and Directory

The header record looks like this:

header

string[4] magic	Magic number. Always "IBSP".
int version	Version number. 0x2e for the BSP files distributed with Quake 3.
