Berkeley Logic Interchange Format (BLIF)
University of California

The goal of BLIF is to describe a logic-level hierarchical circuit in textual form. A circuit is an arbitrary combinational or sequential network of logic functions. A circuit can be viewed as a directed graph of combinational logic nodes and sequential logic elements. Each node has a two-level, single-output logic function associated with it. Each feedback loop must contain at least one latch. Each net (or signal) has only a single driver, and either the signal or the gate which drives the signal can be named without ambiguity.

In the following, angle-brackets surround nonterminals, and square-brackets surround optional constructs.
