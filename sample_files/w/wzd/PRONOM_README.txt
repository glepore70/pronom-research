This is a Sharp ZQ-770 pocket organiser, or if you’re in the US I think they were marketed as the Sharp ‘Wizard OZ series’. I have no idea how many people will actually be familiar with this device. But I owned one of these for many years and thought it was great. It was around before Tablets, iPhones or even touchscreen PDAs. For £70 (at least that’s what I paid) you could get a mini computer that ran off 2AA batteries.

Sadly I’ve not really heard much about these since. I briefly owned a Sharp Zaurus SL-C1000 but didn’t keep that for nearly as long. The point of this article is for anyone who does have one still. A great feature of the organiser was that it could run ‘.wzd’ applications downloaded from a computer. Some 10 years ago there was a website, mywizard.com that had a plethora of such software but it’s since shut down. All files I downloaded, I kept, so thought I’d put up a directory of all the applications I downloaded from the site in case it’s of use to anyone. I have no idea what any of the applications do any more and I no longer own my device so can’t find out. Enjoy the Nostalgia.
