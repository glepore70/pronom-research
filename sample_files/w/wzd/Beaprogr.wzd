"D"," ","Be a programmer1","So you want to be a programmer! It is easy! I am one! I made the programs:1. be a hacker 1 and 22. email-service3. email 1, 2 en 3Nice programs don't you think so? Most of the programs I made in about 1 hour. And I gonna tell you how:  First1. Download from http://www.mywizard.com the program         Basic SDK.2. E-mail me for the program zifnab.3. Don't read the manual from Basic SDK!I am going to tell you what what is:First set on the begin of a line the number: between 10 and 999999999. To set up a tekst U use the print option. You use it like this: 20 PRINT “here your tekst“. You should think why I set it on 20 and not on 10? Because for everything you must say: how  long? That is the WAIT option. WAIT 10 means that it takes 1 second for every line. WAIT means that it will wait until you press any key. This is a sample:10 WAIT 1020 PRINT “HELLO!“30 PRINT “Programming is easy!“40 WAIT50 PRINT “Press enter to continue!“Every program ends with the command: END so it comes like this: 10 WAIT 1020 PRINT “HELLO!“30 PRINT “Programming is easy!“40 WAIT50 PRINT “Press enter to continue!“60 ENDThe INPUT command is to fill in some data. But it won't remember more then 16 letters and numbers (spaces-included). To make an input type this:60 INPUT “Your question“, a letter$That letter reminds the answer.You can print the answer with this command:10 WAIT 1020 PRINT “HELLO!“30 PRINT “Programming is easy!“40 WAIT50 PRINT “Press enter to continue!“60 INPUT “Do you like this? y/n“,A$70 PRINT “Your answer was:“ A$A very nice command is the IF THEN command.An other nice thing is the GOTO command.Here can you see how it works:10 WAIT 1020 PRINT “HELLO!“30 PRINT “Programming is easy!“40 WAIT50 PRINT “Press enter to continue!“60 INPUT “Do you like this? y/n“,A$65 WAIT 3070 PRINT “Your answer was:“ A$80 IF A$=“y“ THEN 1000 [1000] [1000]90 IF A$=“n“ [NEXT]","20000706",,,"4D4953432E",
"D"," ","Be a programmer2","THEN 2000 [2000] [2000]1000 PRINT “I like it to!“1010 INPUT “Do you want to exit? y/n“,B$1020 IF B$=“y“ Then 3000 [3000] [3000]1030 IF B$=“n“ Then 1040 [1040] [1040]1040 WAIT 201050 PRINT “But you have to!“1060 GOTO 3000 [3000] [3000]2000 WAIT 302010 PRINT “Then I think you can better quit!“2020 GOTO 3000 [3000] [3000]3000 WAIT 203010 PRINT “Bye!“3020 ENDYou can type this over in Basic SDK! You can push now on the button called:Then push on the button on the right of it. And then on the button right of that one! Totally you pushed 3 buttons. And the program is now in your myprograms directory! There is lots of more info, but if you want that you have to mail me at V_van_Rij@hotmail.comVictor van RijV_van_Rij@hotmail.com Be a programmer made by:Victor van RijV_van_Rij@hotmail.com(END)","20000706",,,"4D4953432E",
