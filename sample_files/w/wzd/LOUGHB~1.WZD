"D"," ","Loughborough Fa1","Loughborough - Early History Some names of streets in Loughborough date since Saxon, Dane and Norman times, with records appearing from around 1300.It has been estimated that in 1564, Loughborough had 256 houses. The shape of the town, at this time, having changed little since the reign of Edward II (1307-1327 ). There is a record from Edward's reign of a grant for land in Dede Lane:“In Loughborough there is a le Dede Lane, le Bygging, le Kirkgate, le Woodgate and le Tollbothe“.  In the early sixteenth Century, it was recorded that, “ ... most of the houses were made of wood, all with wattle and daub infilling, gleaming plaster and new wood showing evidence of recent extensions, alterations or new erections, for three new ones were built on Bridgeland.“Elizabethan Loughborough was exceedingly wet. From the south ran the Woodbrook. This flowed through the town; entering alongside the Market Place and exiting via The Rushes. The Elizabethan Le Swynesians, now Swan Street, was probably named after a flock of breeding swans that was kept there. Les Russhes, now The Rushes, was where the rushes grew. They were a valuable commodity item for the town and provided an excellent roofing material. Le Kirkegate, now Churchgate, was a central part of the town and housed the wealthier townsfolk. It has retained its original Tudor width of about eighteen feet and remains an excellent indicator to the average breadth of medieval town streets. Sixteenth Century records mention some of the various trades that were in the town. These include a tanner, a glove maker, a dyer, a blacksmith, a baker, a clothier who employed a weaver, a cooper, a rope maker, a barber, a mason, a glazier, a vole and vermin catcher, and various shopkeepers and innkeepers.The stocks, pillory and whipping post stood in the market place and the gibbet may have been on the Forest Road, close to the Blackbrook.A report from the early 1600s described a [NEXT]","20041018",,,"4D4953432E",

The Woodbrook flowed down the open space being crossed at different points by a plank bridge with a hand rail, and reached the Rushes. Here was another old bog as the name denotes, with a raised causeway. There were two pools of water in the town, one in which is now called Devonshire Square and another where the Woodgate ends. Between Loughborough and Shelthorpe, there was a raised footway made of huge stones with bridges of planks here and there, where water tended to accumulate. Somewhere near Shelthorpe, there was a large pool of water which remained as late as the middle of the seventeenth century.“ The Bridgemaster's accounts also itemise much bridging work in and around the town, particularly between 1570 and 1595.In the 16th century, Thomas Burton, a wealthy wool merchant endowed the local Grammar School and Loughborough grew with the development of the woolen industry. Large hosiery and knitwear businesses developed over the next 250 years, with later, local engineering existing such as Cotton's hosiery manufacturing equipment, traction equipment made at the Falcon Works (Brush) and bells made at Taylor's bell foundry.(END)","20041018",,,"4D4953432E",
