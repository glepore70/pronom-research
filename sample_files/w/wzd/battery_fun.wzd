"D"," ","Battery Fun","Idea #1-- "Look! A quarter!"----------------------------(1) Go to a class like a study hall or something. (2) Take a 9V and sit a quarter on top for 4-5 min.(3) Take a pencil, and use it to flick the quarter off the battery into the hall right beforeclass ends.(4) Listen for the screams of agony.Explaination (in case you don't get it):The quarter shorts the battery out, and it feeds back on itself. That makes thebattery get really hot, and the quarter along with it. Then, when some idiot picks the coinup in the hall, they get a nice imprint of George Washington on their palm!Idea #2-- "Let me just get that from my locker"-----------------------------------------------(1) Solder (or tape) a piece of wire to one terminal of the 9V. (Ahead of time)(2) Move the other end of the wire over to touch the other terminal.(3) Wedge the battery (quickly) into the shackle of a Master combo lock.(4) Leave (quickly).(5) Watch for big jock with smoking hand running down hall.Explaination:Again, the wire shorts the battery. This gets said battery HOT. That heat is trans-ferred to the lock by normal laws of thermodynamic heat transfer. When said jock (or whatever)grabs lock to put in combo, his palm turns a nice shade of red (or BLACK!).Idea #3-- "Look, a student dropped this litter"-----------------------------------------------(1) Solder (tape) a piece of wire to one terminal of 9V. (Ahead of time)(2) Move the other end of wire to touch other terminal.(3) Drop (toss) battery in hallway.(4) Wait while in next class.(5) Listen for announcement by a faculty member with a bandaged hand about the person who lefta battery in the hallway.(6) Laugh.Explaination:Is this really necessary? Same deal as #2, except, you let an administrator pick thebattery up. Cool. Or hot.DISCLAIMERI, THE AUTHOR, AM IN NO WAY RESPOPSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE READERS OF THIS FILE.","20010424",,,"",
