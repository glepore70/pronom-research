Worksheet 

Worksheet is a 99- by 99-cell 
spreadsheet that supplies all the basic 
spreadsheet functions necessary to set 
up accounting forms, budget sheets, 
or perform what-if calculations on nu- 
meric data. If you need help, the alter- 
nate and Fl keys bring up instructions 
on how to use it.
