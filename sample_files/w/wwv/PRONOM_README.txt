Collectively, WildTangent's owned and operated service reaches over 20 million monthly players in the United States and Europe with a catalog of more than 1,000 games from nearly 100 developers.

The company launched an Android games service at the end of 2011 with T-Mobile. The company also manages the advertising sales for a group of gaming properties including Mochi Media, Sony Online Entertainment's Free Realms, PopCap, PlayFirst, as well as Artix's AdventureQuest, DragonFable, Namco, and MechQuest properties.

I don't suppose anyone could uncompress a WWV file by chance?

I find it weird that Wild Tangent back in the days, used some kind of compressed format for every file in a game. That had to be a huge waste of CPU power.

Anyways, here is the WWV files: http://www.jeffmakesgames.com/misc/PolarBowler_WWV.zip [Nov 20th reupload]

I do notice in the heading of all 3 WWV files have roughly the same thing in it:

"WLD3.wav WildTangent 3D 300 Compressed and Patented
