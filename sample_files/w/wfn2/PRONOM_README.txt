NOTE: THESE FILES ARE TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM THE C:/COREL50/SYMBOLS DIRECTORY OF A COREL 5.0 INSTALLATION. THE WFN FORMAT ORIGINALLY CONTAINED FONT INFORMATION BUT WAS ALTERED TO CONTAIN SYMBOLS.

I TRIED TO OPEN THESE FILES WITH EVERY APPLICATION INSTALLED BY COREL 5.0, BUT NO LUCK. HOWEVER, I THINK THE PRESENCE OF THESE FILES IN THAT DIRECTORY SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO IDENTIFY THEM.
