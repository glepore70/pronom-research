NOTE: These WAD files are slightly different from Doom/Quake WAD files.

File Formats
Gamestudio and lite-C support numerous file formats for importing and exporting artwork and data.  !!  Keep file names short - the names of entity and texture files (including extension) in WMP and WMB levels are limited to 30 characters, and texture and skin names in WAD and MDL models files are limited to 15 characters. File names must not contain any special characters except "_" or "+". Never, ever, use spaces in your file or path names! Many import filters from other editors will not find texture files when they have spaces or exotic characters in their name.

WAD files are image collections containing several BMP, PCX, TGA, or DDS images, with names and included mipmaps. They are imported in WED and used for level textures. As DDS images are not displayed by WED, they appear as blue squares in the WAD preview.
