The w2d file extension seems to be mainly used for Autodesk Design (Drawing) Web Format.

The w2d file is located in the DWF compressed container Design (Drawing) Web Format with other data to view image in the Design (Drawing) Web format.

After version 6 of the Design Web Format, DWF archives use ZIP compression only with small file header changes. Compression utilities that can extract files from the ZIP archives can extract files from DWF archive.

The w2d files are designed for internal use of Autodesk applications that support Autodesk Design (Drawing) Web Format, to view image properly you must have DWF file.
