Webex Recording Format (WRF) is a proprietary video container format used to store recordings created by Webex, a video conferencing program used mainly in business environments. It appears, based on mentions of a specific codec not "being accepted" by a conversion program[3], to be a container format; the fact that it can use the H.264 codec[3] suggests that it may internally use other widely-used formats, as well. It is possible that it may record other details of the video conference, such as text chat, as well.[4] It succeeded WOT and was succeeded by Advanced Recording Format (although WRF has persisted for recordings made directly by the client software; see the Advanced Recording Format page for details). It seems to share the magic number ASCII WOTF ("WOT File", presumably) with WOT[5][6].
