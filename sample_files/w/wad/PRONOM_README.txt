WAD (which, according to the Doom Bible, is an acronym for "Where's All the Data?"[1]) is the file format used by Doom and all Doom-engine-based games for storing data. A WAD file consists of a header, a directory, and the data lumps that make up the resources stored within the file. A WAD file can be of two types:

IWAD: An "Internal WAD" (or "Initial WAD"), or a core WAD that is loaded automatically (or from a game select menu on source ports) by the engine and generally provides all the data required to run the game.
PWAD: A "Patch WAD", or an optional file that replaces data from the IWAD loaded or provides additional data to the engine.
A WAD file can be read and/or edited by many tools, such as WAD editors.
