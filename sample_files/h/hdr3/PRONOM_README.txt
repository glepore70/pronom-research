HotHelp is a documentation format for the Commodore Amiga. It seems to have originated as the online documentation system of the "Hisoft C++" compiler[2] (maybe also called the "Maxon" C++ compiler[3]), but then extended so that users of that compiler could write their own HotHelp-based documentation to distribute with their programs. Much of the early history of HotHelp is in German.

HotHelp files were probably distributed with the interpreter, "HotView". HotHelp files appear to be usually be found in a directory "hothelp/projecte".
