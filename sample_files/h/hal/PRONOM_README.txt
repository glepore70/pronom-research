Hilgraeve Inc., a privately held software company based just south of Detroit in Monroe, Michigan, is a long-time leader in meeting the mission-critical communication needs of business. Hilgraeve’s data communications software and services enable businesses to become faster and more competitive through the use of electronic communications. Hilgraeve provides reliable, powerful and easy-to-use communications solutions.

Hilgraeve, Inc. was founded in 1980 to develop and market technological products.  Hilgraeve’s first product was a bicycle speedometer, introduced in 1981.  That led to the manufacture of proximity sensors in 1982.  Though sensors continued to be a source of revenue for more than a decade, Hilgraeve’s focus on microcomputers and telecommunications eventually established the company as a technology leader in the field of computer communications software.

The original founders in 1980 were John Hile, Matt Gray, and Bob Everett.  The company’s name was derived from the first three letters of each of the founder’s last names.

In 1985, Hilgraeve was awarded a patent for technology for coin validation in vending machines.   A year later, that technology was sold to Mars Money Systems, a division of Mars Candy Bar Company.  Revenue from the sale was used to bankroll aggressive expansion in Hilgraeve’s software development and marketing, which had been gaining momentum throughout the early ‘80s.

Hilgraeve released its first computer software in 1982, to enable Heath 8-bit computers to communicate through modems and telephone lines.  In 1985, Hilgraeve released HyperACCESS for IBM PC and PC compatible computers with DOS.  HyperACCESS won critical acclaim immediately, and has remained one of the top-rated communications programs ever since.

Competition heated up in the early 1990s and Hilgraeve would compete in the online communications software market against the likes of Datastorm’s ProComm line of software, and Delrina’s WinComm.

In 1994 IBM was the first major OS vendor to bundle one of Hilgraeve’s products with a 32-bit OS by including a copy of the firm’s terminal program with OS/2 Warp 3.0, and it was named “HyperACCESS Lite.” One year later Microsoft followed suit and licensed a low-end version known as HyperTerminal (essentially a “Lite” version) for use in their set of communications utilities.  It was initially bundled with Windows 95, and subsequently all versions of Windows up to and including Windows XP.
