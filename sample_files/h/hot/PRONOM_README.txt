Anders Oland (.hot). Created by Anders Oland for the game
Prime Mover. Thanks to Wanted Team for the player (EP) and modules,
and to Muerto for supplying them. Note that the guy's surname really
is Ã˜land, but for various reasons format folder names shouldn't include
characters outside 7-bit ASCII. It's often written Oland or 0land.
