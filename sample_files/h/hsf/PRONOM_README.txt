HSF FORMAT

The HOOPS Stream File (HSF) format is a robust, customizable and highly compressed 2D/3D visualization format specifically tailored to the needs of displaying engineering data. Through the OpenHSF Initiative, the HSF Specification has been openly published and the OpenHSF Advisory Council has been formed to advise on extensions to the format specification. Using HSF, application developers can create highly customized, stream-capable visualization files containing tessellated geometry as well as application-specific information (such as assembly structure, analysis data, topological data, object behaviors, etc.) and have that data intelligently associated with the tessellated model.
