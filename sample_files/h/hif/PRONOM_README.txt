Hellfire, often called Diablo: Hellfire, is an expansion pack for the video game Diablo, developed by Synergistic Software, a Sierra division, and published by Sierra On-Line in 1997. Despite the objections of Blizzard Entertainment, the Hellfire expansion was produced, permitted by Davidson & Associates, their parent company at the time. Blizzard North, who was developing the sequel Diablo II, thus imposed numerous restrictions upon Synergistic Software's development of Hellfire.[3]

Hellfire was re-released alongside Diablo in 1998 in a bundle called Diablo + Hellfire. Hellfire was released digitally by Blizzard Entertainment on June 5, 2019 as a free add-on with every purchase of the original Diablo on GOG.com.[4][5]
