The HES (Hudson Entertainment System) file format is used to store music and audio data ripped from PC Engine / TurboGrafx-16 games. A .hes file consists of audio and code ripped from the original game, plus an appended player which allows the file to be played back in an emulator. HES files lack an efficient inbuilt header, necessitating the distribution of an M3U playlist along with them to contain e.g. track title information.

The format was specified by Takashi Mamiya on Aug. 17, 2000
