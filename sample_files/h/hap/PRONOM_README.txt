HAP (or Hap, or Hap and Pah) is compression software for DOS, developed by Harald Feldmann and Hamarsoft.

There are probably just two publicly-distributable versions of HAP: v2.10 and v3.00. There are other versions that are commercial software. The file format is proprietary.

HAP 2.10 compresses a single file. HAP 3.00+ makes multi-file compressed archives.

The HAP software consists of a "HAP" program for compression, and a "PAH" program for decompression.
