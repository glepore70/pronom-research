Hydrogen is an open source drum machine created by Alessandro Cominu, an Italian programmer who goes by the pseudonym Comix.[1] Its main goal is to provide professional yet simple and intuitive pattern-based drum programming.

Hydrogen was originally developed for Linux, and later ported to Mac OS X. Support for Microsoft Windows seemed to have been abandoned, since the last build dated to 2006 for 4 years.[2] However, a Windows port exists since the 0.9.6 version,[3] and it is now in beta stage.[4] The graphical user interface for the application uses Qt library, and all code is released under GPL-2.0-or-later.
