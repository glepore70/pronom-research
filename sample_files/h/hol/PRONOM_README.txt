 Corel and Time Line Solutions Announces Corel Time Line
                         Project Management Software
                                      
      New Software To Be Incorporated Into Corel Office Professional 7
                                      
Ottawa, Canada - July 15, 1996 - Corel Corporation and Time Line Solutions
Corporation (TLSC) today announced Corel Time Line, a PC-based project
management system that will be included in Corel's newest suite, Corelr
Office Professional 7.  Corel Time Line features powerful multi-project
management tools specifically tailored to the needs of today's corporate
managers.

Based on TLSC's award winning Time Line 6.5, Corel Time Line allows users to
plan projects around real-life situations and anticipate actual results by
tracking required tasks, resources, dependencies and cost.  By building every
imaginable scenario into a particular plan, managers can create various "what
if" scenarios and manage projects effectively as they change and develop.

Because Corel Time Line is intended for use by managers and professionals who
might not be familiar with project management software, a number of features
have been added to facilitate ease-of-use including an assortment of
templates for different types of projects ranging from developing business
plans and creating publications to orchestrating an office move or even
building an addition to a home.  The software also includes a direct link to
an Internet help page that provides the most up-to-date information related
to the product.
