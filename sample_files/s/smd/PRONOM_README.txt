Studiomdl Data

SMD has been superseded by the DMX model format.
The Studiomdl Data file format (SMD) stores 3D models in ASCII for analysis and compilation by studiomdl. SMD files are usually generated by an SMD export plug-in for a given model editor package like MilkShape.

Aside from Source and GoldSrc, SMD is known to be used by Sauerbraten and third party tools for The Sims and Mount & Blade.

General notes
X is north in SMD. Elsewhere in Source it is east.
The format is carriage return sensitive: Linux-based text editors should use CR or CRLF line terminators instead of just LF. each command must be on a separate line. There should also be a single blank line at the end (and only the end) of the file.
White space is the only delimiter: any combination of tabs and spaces can be used to separate values, and for this reason multiword names should be enclosed in "quotation marks".
￼ Bug: 	Avoid using tab. Its presence can crash studiomdl in very large SMDs.
Stand-alone line comments start with // (double foreslash)
End-line comments start with # (hashtag) or ; (semicolon)
Types
Reference / Collision
A complete snapshot of the model, including one frame of animation to define the default pose. Collision meshes follow the same pattern.
header
nodes
skeleton
triangles
Animation
A single skeletal animation.

Vertex
A flex animation library. Usually has extension .vta.

Data blocks
Here are the components of an SMD file, considered in order:

￼ Tip: 	Unless otherwise noted all integer values begin at 0 and all floating point values are limited to six decimal places.
Header
Simply:

version 1
Nodes
A list of all the bones in the model.

￼ Note: 	Bones without attached vertices will not be compiled.
Syntax
nodes
Starts the node block.
<int|ID> "<string|Bone Name>" <int|Parent ID>
A bone definition. Unique ID number (does not have to be sequential), name in quote marks and the parent bone's ID. Bones without parents (i.e. children of the world) have a Parent ID of -1.
￼ Note: 	Studiomdl matches bones across SMDs by name. IDs are internal to each file.
end
Ends the data block.
Example
A root bone with one child:

nodes
0 "root" -1
1 "child" 0
end
Skeleton
Position data for each bone in each animation frame. In a reference SMD there is only one frame, which contains the model's default posture.
