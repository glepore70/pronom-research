SoundFX is a tracker for the Commodore Amiga (not to be confused with the other Amiga SoundFX, a sample editing software) which produces modules with the extensions .sfx and .sfx2.

There appear to be at least four different versions of the format - v1.0, v1.8, v1.9 and v2.0. The first three versions seem to have the extension .sfx, with v2.0 using the extension .sfx2.
