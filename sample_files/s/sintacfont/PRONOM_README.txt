Interactive fiction, often abbreviated IF, is software simulating environments in which players use text commands to control characters and influence the environment. Works in this form can be understood as literary narratives, either in the form of interactive narratives or interactive narrations. These works can also be understood as a form of video game,[1] either in the form of an adventure game or role-playing game. In common usage, the term refers to text adventures, a type of adventure game where the entire interface can be "text-only",[2] however, graphical text adventures still fall under the text adventure category if the main way to interact with the game is by typing text. Some users of the term distinguish between interactive fiction, known as "Puzzle-free", that focuses on narrative, and "text adventures" that focus on puzzles.

Due to their text-only nature, they sidestepped the problem of writing for widely divergent graphics architectures. This feature meant that interactive fiction games were easily ported across all the popular platforms at the time, including CP/M (not known for gaming or strong graphics capabilities). The number of interactive fiction works is increasing steadily as new ones are produced by an online community, using freely available development systems.

The term can also be used to refer to digital versions of literary works that are not read in a linear fashion, known as gamebooks, where the reader is instead given choices at different points in the text; these decisions determine the flow and outcome of the story. The most famous example of this form of printed fiction is the Choose Your Own Adventure book series, and the collaborative "addventure" format has also been described as a form of interactive fiction.[3] The term "interactive fiction" is sometimes used also to refer to visual novels, a type of interactive narrative software popular in Japan.

Authoring Systems

In addition to writing new IF games, the Spanish community has also built some 
authoring systems just for IF in Spanish. 

Halfway through 1992, the first Spanish IF development system for PC-compatibles 
was published.  SINTAC was based upon PAWS, and written by Javier San José 
("JSJ"). Initially distributed with a shareware license, and becoming freeware 
some time later, it had quite a large user base for a time, but was abandoned in 
2000. 

During the next few years, many other authoring systems, more or less related to 
PAWS, appeared for PC or for some of the other common computers of that time. 
NMP, another "PAWS-like", was also very well known. 

At the end of 1992 the first completely native Spanish authoring system for the 
PC, CAECHO?, was released by Juan Antonio Paz Salgado ("Mel Hython") and some 
other contributors. CAECHO? marked a major advance over PAWS and its 
derivatives, being a complete structured programming language rather than being 
built around the "condition lists" of PAWS.  

In October of 1998 José Luis Díaz ("Zak McKraken") released InformATE ("Inform 
Ahora Totalmente en Español" - "Inform Now Completely in Spanish"), a Spanish 
library for Inform based upon the English Inform 6.30. InformATE has seen huge 
acceptance in the Spanish community, generating a healthy amount of 
documentation, utilities, and of course games. 

Some months later, in June of 1999, the author of SINTAC released the first 
version of a new system called Visual SINTAC.  While only available for Windows 
machines, it was the first Spanish parser to provide a complete GUI as a help to 
the programmer.  However, the project is abandoned today.
