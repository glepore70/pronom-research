MaxView Corporate Overview
MaxView Corporation and its predecessors have been involved in the development, distribution and support of document distribution software technologies since the mid-1990s with users in several markets including construction, manufacturing, and governmental county assessors. In particular, our original product called ‘SourceView’ helped pioneer the movement towards the electronic distribution of large-scale engineering and design drawings for construction bid solicitations which today is common practice in the industry. SourceView enabled non-technical document recipients to easily access, view and locally print project information from major owners such as the US Army Corps of Engineers and the US Air Force. As a result of this early success MaxView Corporation was formed as a Washington state corporation in 2000 with specific focus on the construction industry.  MaxView is headquartered in Everett Washington (a suburb of Seattle) with additional facilities located in Roanoke, Virginia; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; as well as Vancouver and Toronto, Canada.    The first release of our main product family (also called MaxView) occurred in 2000 and is an upward-compatible replacement for ‘SourceView’.  This second-generation development incorporates a complete re-development of the original product to include state-of-the-art design such as Smart Document™, Pay-As-You-Go licensing and advanced document security that enables effective document distribution implementations for the construction industry.
