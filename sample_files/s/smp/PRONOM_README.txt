The Sample	Vision File Format (smp) was developed for use with the	Sample
     Vision software program, which was	designed to send and receive samples
     via the MIDI interface on a PC.  It consists of a variable-length header
     followed by a contiguous block of binary data representing	the sound
     samples.
