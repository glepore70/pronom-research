S-PLUS is a commercial implementation of the S programming language sold by TIBCO Software Inc.

It features object-oriented programming capabilities and advanced analytical algorithms.

Due to the increasing popularity of the open source S successor R, TIBCO Software released the TIBCO Enterprise Runtime for R (TERR) as an alternative R interpreter.[1]

It begins with the

> manual which seemed to indicate that data.restore might do the trick.
> Alas, it seems that function is trying to interpret the name of the data
> frame as an S mode or some such thing.
