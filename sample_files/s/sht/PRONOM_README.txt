Challenge of Golf, won Computer Gaming World's 1991 Action Game of the Year award.[1]

Several versions of the game and expansion packs (containing new courses[2] and golfers[3] mainly) were created for the Mac and PC over the years. In 1996, Access Software introduced Links LS 1997, the first of several Links games to use the LS (Legends in Sports) title.[4] A version for the Xbox named Links 2004 was released in November 2003. It would be the final game in the series. In March 2004, Microsoft announced the cancellation of its 2004 lineup of sports games, allowing the company to focus on improving such games. The company stated, "Links is something that we're taking a hard look at what we need to do."[5] At the end of 2004, Microsoft sold Indie Built (formerly Access Software) to Take-Two Interactive.[6][7] Indie Built was later shut down in 2006.

Many members of the development team now work for TruGolf, a golf simulator company based out of Centerville, Utah.[8] In 2021, TruGolf re-acquired the rights to the Links series, re-releasing classic editions on GOG, as well as a new title, Links E6, the first in 17 years.
