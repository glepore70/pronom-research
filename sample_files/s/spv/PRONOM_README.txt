SPIR-V is a simple binary intermediate language for graphical shaders and compute kernels. A SPIR-V module contains multiple entry points with potentially shared functions in the entry pointâ€™s call trees. Each function contains a control-flow graph (CFG) of basic blocks, with optional instructions to express structured control flow. Load/store instructions are used to access declared variables, which includes all input/output (IO). Intermediate results bypassing load/store use static single-assignment (SSA) representation. Data objects are represented logically, with hierarchical type information: There is no flattening of aggregates or assignment to physical register banks, etc. Selectable addressing models establish whether general pointer operations may be used, or if memory access is purely logical.



3.1. Magic Number
Magic number for a SPIR-V module.

TIP
Endianness: A module is defined as a stream of words, not a stream of bytes. However, if stored as a stream of bytes (e.g., in a file), the magic number can be used to deduce what endianness to apply to convert the byte stream back to a word stream.
