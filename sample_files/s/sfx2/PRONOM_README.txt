SFX (Self-Extracting Archive) is an archive format for the Commodore 64 and 128 consisting of files compressed in the LHA format and appended to a program to extract them, so that the archive and its extractor is self-contained and no other program needs to be downloaded or installed in order to extract the archive. Unlike the SDA format (which this one succeeded), the extractor is cross-compatible between both Commodore platforms (C-64 and C-128).
