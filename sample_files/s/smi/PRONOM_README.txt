Lotus Smart Icon (.smi) is an icon format associated with Lotus products, including Lotus SmartSuite.

Files begin with ASCII "IC". (This could cause SMI to be confused with OS/2 Icon, but they are not the same format.)

In at least some files, the next three bytes are 0x34 0x03 0x00. At offset 5 is an ASCII name.
