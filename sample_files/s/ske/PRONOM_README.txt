Has anyone tried editing .ske files through developer tools in SolidWorks 2012? Back in 2008 I made changes to several hole sketches and I don't recall any issues. But I can't even open those files in 2012, I just get an error message, "An Invalid Argument Was Encountered". Any suggestions?

Does any one know anything about the files with the extention .ske
in the solidworks directory? Is there a way to open these files? is
there a way to create these files? how does the program use them?Just
interested and thought I'd ask.

These are the sketch files SolidWorks uses for the hole wizard. To edit them
you need to start SolidWorks with a "/d"  as a command line argument. When
you open a part you should see an additional menu named "Developer Tools".
The "Read Section" and "Make Section" menu picks open and save the sketches.
