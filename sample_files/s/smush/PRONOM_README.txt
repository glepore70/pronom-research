SAN stands for Smush Animation Format. It is a full motion video format used in a number of different LucasArts games initially created by Vince Lee. What follows are some random notes based on examining files as well as decoders from versions of the ScummVM and Residual applications which are open source reimplementations of interpreters of some of the games that used SAN.
