New Feature Summary (partial list)
SuperLink Portable Applications
The Application/Compile-Portable-App command can be used to compress a SuperLink application into a single compressed file. Using the SuperLink Runtime, the Portable Application can be run over the Internet or can be conveniently transported on CD-ROM or diskette for use at another site.
New SuperLink Runtime
The SuperLink Runtime program is now distributed at no charge for non-commercial educational use. It can be used to publish a SuperLink Portable Application via diskette or CD-ROM. It can also be used to run a Portable Application directly over the Internet. The SuperLink Runtime program can be installed as a Netscape Navigator (tm) helper application or a Microsoft Explorer (tm) viewer program. This permits the user to execute a SuperLink Portable application found on a web page from within the network browser.
Tiled Background Pictures
In the Folder/Attributes Dialog Box, you can now choose to indicate a picture file to be used as a tiled background image for the folder. The picture image is repeated horizontally and virtically to fill the entire page.
Bold And Italic Text Markup In Field Objects
Field objects can be enhanced with bold and italics. When editing the text of a field object, the EDIT menu contains 3 new commands: BOLD, ITALIC and PLAIN. This enables one to select and mark portions of the text as bold, italic or plain text.
Offset Display To Center The Page
The OFFSETX and OFFSETY options of the WINDOWS statement can be used to center the page display when an application is run at a higher resolution than that at which it was authored.
Disk Drive Portability
Transfer of a Superlink Application from one site to another, is simplified by the "/L" command line parameter which adjusts full path file references so they can work on any destination drive.
Adjustable Picture Cache Enhances Performance
SuperLink keeps the most recently displayed picture images in a RAM picture cache, so that if the same image is to be displayed again, it can be done without the delay of fetching the image file from disk. The author can control the number of pictures saved in the cache.
Multiple-Image GIF Pictures Supported
When creating a picture object to display a GIF picture, you can insert a picture number in the Piture Object Dialog box. This enables display of other than the first picture. Multiple images are also supported by the PLOAD and CHANGE statements.
Playing GIF Animations
Animated GIF files can be played. Sample scripts are provided to show several ways to do this. See the sample folder SAMPGIFA.SLF for examples.
