The Septentrio PolaRxS PRO GNSS receiver performs over multiple frequencies and constellations. It is used for ionospheric monitoring and space weather observations.

Equipped with very low noise control and the companyâ€™s newest tracking engine, the Septentrio PolaRxS PRO features high-quality, simultaneous Galileo, GLONASS and GPS signal tracking. It also contains adaptive interference analysis and mitigation (AIM+), advanced multipath mitigation (APME+) and tracking stability technology (LOCK+).

PolaRxS is especially valuable for tracking rapid signal dynamics like those found in scintillation events. Its advanced technology for analyzing interference and notch filtering for mitigation allows installation in environments difficult for radio broadcasting.

SBF is the binary output format of Septentrio receivers. In this format, the data are arranged in binary blocks referred to as SBF blocks.
