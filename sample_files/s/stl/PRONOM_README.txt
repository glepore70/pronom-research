AppleWorks is an integrated office suite containing a word processor, database, and spreadsheet. It was developed by Rupert Lissner for Apple Computer, originally for the Apple II platform and launched in 1984, and was later reworked for the Macintosh platform.

The Apple subsidiary Claris created the new successor ClarisWorks for Apple IIGS (1988), Macintosh (1991), and Windows (1993). Those applications do not share any code with the 8-bit Apple II original. Apple absorbed Claris and the name ClarisWorks was changed to AppleWorks. It was bundled with all consumer-level Macintoshes sold by Apple until its discontinuation. As of 2007, AppleWorks had not been updated in several years and was unable to run on the Intel processors shipping in new Macs. On August 15, 2007, Apple announced AppleWorks had reached end-of-life status, and would no longer be sold.[3] Apple instead promoted its recently launched iWork suite as a replacement, which contains word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation applications with capabilities similar to AppleWorks, but is not directly compatible with AppleWorks file formats.

AppleWorks and ClarisWorks (Macintosh and Windows, 1991â€“2004)[edit]
The second incarnation of AppleWorks began as ClarisWorks, written by Bob Hearn and Scott Holdaway and published by Claris, a wholly owned subsidiary of Apple, also known as FileMaker Inc.)[16] The Creator code of ClarisWorks for the Macintosh is "BOBO". The file extension of AppleWorks and ClarisWorks for Windows is .cwk for documents and .cws for templates.[17] ClarisWorks combines these applications:[18]

a word processor, which in version 6 also includes an equation editor based on MathType.[19]
a drawing program,
a painting program,
a spreadsheet,
a database program, and
a terminal program for communications (up to and including version 5), or
a presentation program (in version 6).
All the components are integrated to provide a seamless suite that works in concert; for example, spreadsheet frames can be embedded in a word processing document, or formatted text into drawings, etc. The components are not derived from the contemporary Claris programs MacWrite and MacDraw but written from scratch and then redesigned to match other Claris programs after the purchase by Claris.[16]

ClarisWorks 1.0 shipped for the Macintosh in October 1991.[16]

ClarisWorks 2.0 was released on March 24, 1993.[20]

ClarisWorks 3.0 was released in October 1994.[21] It is the last version to run on the 68000 CPU with at least System 6.0.7.

ClarisWorks 4.0 was released on June 14, 1995.[20] It requires a 68020 CPU and System 7.
