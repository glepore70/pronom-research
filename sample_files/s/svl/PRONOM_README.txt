Sonic Visualiser is a free, open-source application for Windows, Linux, and Mac, designed to be the first program you reach for when want to study a music recording closely. It's designed for musicologists, archivists, signal-processing researchers, and anyone else looking for a friendly way to look at what lies inside the audio file.

2.4  Annotation Layer Import
Sonic Visualiser can import comma-separated (CSV) or tab-separated text data files as new annotation layers, whose type will depend on the format of data in the files and your preferences when importing the data. Sonic Visualiser can currently import data to time instants, time values, and colour 3D plot layers.

To import data from a text file, use the File â†’ Import Annotation Layer and specify the proper file type in the import dialog.

You can also use this function to import data from Sonic Visualiser's own .svl layer file format, which is an XML format; any type of editable layer may be exported and imported to this format.
