SubRip is a free software program for Microsoft Windows which extracts subtitles and their timings from various video formats to a text file. It is released under the GNU GPL.[4] Its subtitle format's file extension is .srt and is widely supported. Each .srt file is a human-readable file format where the subtitles are stored sequentially along with the timing information. Most subtitles distributed on the Internet are in this format.[5][6]

The SubRip file format is described on the Matroska multimedia container format website as "perhaps the most basic of all subtitle formats."[13] SubRip (SubRip Text) files are named with the extension .srt, and contain formatted lines of plain text in groups separated by a blank line. Subtitles are numbered sequentially, starting at 1. The timecode format used is hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds with time units fixed to two zero-padded digits and fractions fixed to three zero-padded digits (00:00:00,000). The fractional separator used is the comma, since the program was written in France.

A numeric counter identifying each sequential subtitle
The time that the subtitle should appear on the screen, followed by --> and the time it should disappear
Subtitle text itself on one or more lines
A blank line containing no text, indicating the end of this subtitle[13]
