Capturing information about a C or C++ program’s structure has been around for a very long time in Microsoft’s products.  Preceding even Visual C++ 1.0, the compiler supported generating program information through .SBR and .BSC files.  (Note:  The compiler in Visual C++ 1.0 was already version 8, so the command line tools had been around a while already.)  The SBR files contain reference and definition information for a single translation unit that the compiler generates as it compiles.  These SBR files are combined in a later step using the BSCMAKE tool to generate a BSC file.  This file can then be used to look at many different aspects of a program:  reference, definitions, caller-callee graphs, macros, etc.
