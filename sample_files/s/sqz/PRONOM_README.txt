DIET (compression)
Released	1991
DIET is an executable compression and file compression utility for DOS, developed by Teddy Matsumoto. It does executable compression of EXE and COM files.

It can also compress arbitrary data files. Such files can be transparently decompressed by DIET's TSR utility.

Both types of files can be decompressed using the -ra option.

Identification
Compressed data files apparently start with bytes b4 4c cd 21 9d 89 64 6c 7a.

EXE files most likely have ASCII "diet" at offset 28.
