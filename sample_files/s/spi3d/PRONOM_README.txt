SPI3D File Type - The quick facts
What are SPI3D files and how to open them
Are you having problems opening a SPI3D file or just wondering what they contain? We explain what these files are used for and show you software that we know can open or otherwise handle your files.

What is a SPI3D file?
A .SPI3D file is an Imageworks 3D LUT format file. Through our analysis of SPI3D files, we know that one use of the format is Imageworks 3D LUT format. We have not yet described in detail what these files contain and what they are used for, but our team is working tiredlessly through thousands of file formats. We'd love hearing from you if you have information about the format.
