AutoSketch is a 2D vector drawing program by Autodesk. It is less powerful than Autodesk's AutoCAD and does not support 3D models.

AutoSketch uses SKD and SKF, in later versions, as its native format,[citation needed] but can support DWG and DXF. Version 2.1 for Windows supported macros which has been removed in later versions.
