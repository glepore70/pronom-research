Terragenâ„¢ is a powerful solution for building, rendering, and animating realistic natural environments. Create entire worlds from your imagination, or import real world terrain data sets and use Terragen to create the most realistic visualizations possible. You control the weather, landscape, rivers, lakes and oceans, suns, moons and stars. With Terragen you have complete control over the shader networks used for terrains, textures, micropolygon displacements, clouds and object distributions. You can reorganize the planetary shading pipeline to suit your goals. Place grass and trees wherever you want, as well as other objects in native TGO or OBJ format that you have modeled in third party software.

You can also save separate components of the scene in a more fine-grained way as "clip files". The only equivalent to this in Terragen Classic would have been the saving of separate .ATM and .SRF (atmosphere and surface) files. But in Terragen 3 you can save any combination of different shaders/nodes as a clip file and re-use it later.
