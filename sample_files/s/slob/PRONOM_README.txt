Slob (sorted list of blobs) is a read-only, compressed data store with dictionary-like interface to look up content by text keys. Keys are sorted according to Unicode Collation Algorithm. This allows to perform punctuation, case and diacritics insensitive lookups. slob.py is a reference implementation of slob format reader and writer in Python 3.
