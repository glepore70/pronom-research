Chapter 6: Creating or Changing Collating Sequences
About collating sequence files
Sybase collating sequence files are named *.srt and are located in the charsets/charset_name/ directory. All collating sequence files use standard Sybase external localization file syntax.

For more information on localization file syntax, see Appendix B, “External Localization File Syntax.”

Collating sequence file example
This section contains an example of a case-sensitive collating sequence file.

Actual collating sequence files are included in your Sybase directory tree as charsets/charset_name/*.srt.
