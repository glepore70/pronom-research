BASESET mapping files (*.SET)
BASESET mapping files are activated in an SGML declaration and are not
used in XML. A BASESET mapping file is an ASCII file that describes a
BASESET of characters in terms of WordPerfect Characters. This file
contains one or more BASESET mapping entries. Each BASESET mapping
entry corresponds to a particular character in the BASESET being described
and specifies the following two fields of information:
Ÿ The decimal number representing the character’s position in the
BASESET.
Ÿ The character set and character number of the WordPerfect character that
most closely matches the BASESET character.
