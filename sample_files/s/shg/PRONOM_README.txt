Segmented Hypergraphics (SHG), and its alter-ego Multiple Resolution Bitmap (MRB), are graphics formats used almost exclusively in the development of HLP (WinHelp) files. An SHG/MRB file contains one or more images in a BMP-like format, or WMF format. It also contains information about regions of the images that should be treated as hyperlinks.

Loosely speaking, SHG files are supposed to contain a single image, while MRB files contain more than one image. In practice, neither the file extension nor the file signature can be relied upon to be consistent with the image count, so the definition of SHG vs. MRB may be a matter of opinion.
