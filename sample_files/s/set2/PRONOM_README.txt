Vocal Eyes is a product developed by GW Micro for visually impaired computer users. The purpose of the product is to "read" the MS-DOS screen for the user. Vocal Eyes also includes a keyboard key speech function. When keys on the keyboard are pressed, their values are spoken. This part of the Vocal Eyes program still functions properly under Windows 3.1.

The program does work with MS-DOS-based applications under Windows if the Vocal Eyes program is loaded after you choose the MS-DOS Prompt icon.
