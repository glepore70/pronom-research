The SAP (Slight Atari Player) format, like SID or NSF, contains the machine code instructions for creating the sound effects and music for an 8-bit Atari program. The 8-bit Atari computers, as well as early Atari arcade cabinets, contained a sound chip called POKEY (POtentiometer and KEYboard). The chip, developed by Doug Neubauer, was responsible for converting the data sent by the machine code into audio data to be sent to speakers.

The format shares the name of the first player capable of playing the format, Another Slight Atari Player.
