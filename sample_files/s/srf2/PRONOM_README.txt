Profile Manager
A new feature available only to Cubase Pro users is the Profile Manager, which will be useful in situations where you have multiple users working on the same Cubase rig who have different predilections when it comes to configurable aspects of the program like Preferences and key commands. With the Profile Manager, each user can now create a different Profile to store their personal configuration, and you can then switch between Profiles without have to mess around in the murkier depths of the file system where Cubase stores user settings.

A Profile consists of Preferences, toolbar settings for all windows, Global Workspaces, Track Control presets and settings, presets for input and output buses, plugâ€“in collections, quantise and crossfade presets, and, of course, key commands. Profiles are managed in the new Profile Manager window (which can be opened from the File menu), and this is where you can create or duplicate existing Profiles, delete and rename them, and even import and export them as a single SRF file. These latter commands are potentially useful to those who have multiple Cubase rigs, as it makes moving configurations between rigs much cleaner, with just a single file to worry about.
