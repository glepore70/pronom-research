  Created  by  John  Iannetta  around  1995,  these  are  mostly  found  in
Compuserve's CBM applications forum, but do appear in the COMP.BINARIES.CBM
newsgroup as well. It is a self-extracting file, and does  not  employ  any
compression. The word "SPYNE" does not represent any acronym, but is  meant
to represent a "spine", with files linked together like a human spine.
