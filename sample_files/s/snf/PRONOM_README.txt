SNF (Server Normal Format) was a bitmap font format used by the X Window System. It is more or less a binary version of BDF, and was a non-portable predecessor to PCF. The SNF format was introduced in X11R1, and deprecated in X11R5 in 1991 with the introduction of PCF fonts. The release of libXfont 1.5.0 in 2014 disabled building snf support by default, though left the code able to be enabled at compile time.
