SC68 is a file format for replaying Atari ST, Atari STE or Amiga music, created by Benjamin Gerard.

It is a similar design to the SID format, where the music replayer code music data and metadata are all bundled into one file, and are played by running the replayer code in an emulated environment. No music is natively created in this format, it exists to preserve "ripped" music extracted from games and demos.

There have not been many new files created in the SC68 format since 2003. The Atari SoundHeader format is now more popular for Atari music and the Custom Amiga Module format is more popular as a catch-all format for Amiga music.
