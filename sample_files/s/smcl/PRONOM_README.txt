SMCL is markup language of Stata and mastering it helps you create nicer outputs for your packages and also, write better help files. In this article I talk about the importance of learning SMCL before beginning any programming course. Having a good knowledge of SMCL is essential for writing appealing help files as well as creating nice Stata outputs for the programs and packages you author. Therefore, being skilled in SMCL should be an important milestone on your way to Stata programming.

Introduction
SMCL (pronunced /smikl/), which stands for Stata Markup and Control Language is the markup language of Stata and it is used everywhere, from help files to tables of Stata outputs and logfiles. So what is markup language? Is markup language a programming language? This is often a confusing question. This article discusses the differences between Markup and programming languages in detail and is recommended to any of you who is not familiar with programming.

In brief, markup languages are computer languages in a sense that they include syntax and are interpretted by computers. They are mainly used for annotating a document. For example, LaTeX, HTML, XHTML, and XML all are markup languages that are used for annotating documents. SMCL is designed based on the same consept and it includes syntax that can be interpreted by Stata for creating electronic documents such as help files, log files, and results' window outputs. In this article I introduce you to the most important syntax of SMCL markup language which in my opinion is essential for improving the output of your programs and help files.
