TADS 3 (Text Adventure Development System) is an Interactive Fiction development system by Michael J. Roberts. Plain text source code files are created using the TADS 3 programming language, and then compiled into a system-independent game file. Compiled game files can be played on any system that has an appropriate interpreter.
