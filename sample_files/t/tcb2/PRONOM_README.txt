Readers of Computer Music from issue 128 onwards will find a copy of CMplay on the cover DVD.

CMplay is based on Muon Software Ltd's Tachyon virtual sampler engine and gives you a friendly and quick interface to browse and play the samples on the Cover DVD as ready made sampler patches. It can also import DS404 patches/banks and SR202 drumkits. There are only limited parameter editing capabilities, but most onscreen controls can be automated via MIDI and there are also four fully-editable FX units built in.

Muon Software Ltd was brought in to create a branded player based on TachyonP and a content development platform based on TachyonS. Computer Music magazine's sample producers use the content development platform to import, map and create performances of their samples before supplying them to the magazine for publication. Tachyon Patch files and the original source samples are included on the DVD so users still have complete flexibility over how they use their samples - in CMplay, or in their favourite audio software.
