Turbo Debugger (TD) is a machine-level debugger for DOS executables, intended mainly for debugging Borland Turbo Pascal, and later Turbo C programs, sold by Borland. It is a full-screen debugger displaying both Turbo Pascal or Turbo C source and corresponding assembly-language instructions, with powerful capabilities for setting breakpoints, watching the execution of instructions, monitoring machine registers, etc. Turbo Debugger can be used for programs not generated by Borland compilers, but without showing source statements; it is by no means the only debugger available for non-Borland executables, and not a significant general-purpose debugger.

Although Borland's Turbo Pascal has useful single-stepping and conditional breakpoint facilities, the need for a more powerful debugger became apparent when Turbo Pascal started to be used for serious development.

Initially, a separate company, TurboPower Software, produced a debugger, T-Debug, and also their Turbo Analyst and Overlay Manager for Turbo Pascal for versions 1 to 3. TurboPower released T-Debug Plus 4.0 for Turbo Pascal 4.0 in 1988,[1] but by then Borland's Turbo Debugger had been announced.[2]

The original Turbo Debugger was sold as a stand-alone product introduced in 1989,[3] along with Turbo Assembler and the second version of Turbo C.

To use Turbo Debugger with source display, programs, or relevant parts of programs, must be compiled with Turbo Pascal or Turbo C with a conditional directive set to add debugging information to the compiled executable, with related source statements and corresponding machine code. The debugger can then be started (Turbo Debugger does not debug within the development IDE). After debugging the program can be recompiled without debugging information to reduce its size.

Turbo Debugger's configuration files Turbo Debugger uses the following configuration, initialization, and session-state files when it starts: • TDCONFIG.TD • TDCONFIG.TDW • TDCONFIG.TD2 • TDW.INI • XXXX.TR • XXXX.TRW • XXXX.TR2 The configuration files TDCONFIG.TD, TDCONFIG.TDW, and TDCONFIG.TD2 are created and used by TD, TDW, and TD32, respectively. The settings in these files override the default configuration settings of the debuggers. You can modify the configuration files using the installation programs TDINST.EXE, TDWINST.EXE, and TD32INST. TDW.INI is the initialization file used by TDW.EXE and TD32.EXE. It contains settings for the video driver used with Turbo Debugger, the location of TDWINTH.DLL (the Windows-debugging DLL), and the remote debugging settings you specify using WRSETUP.EXE. The installation program places a copy of TDW.INI in the main Windows directory. In this copy of TDW.INI, the video driver setting ([VideoDLL 1) is set to SVGA.DLL, and the DebuggerDLL setting indicates the path to TDWINTH.DLL. Refer to the online file TD _ HELP!.TXT for a complete description of TDW.INI. Files ending with .TR, .TRW, and .TR2 extensions contain the session-state settings for the debuggers. For information on session-state saving, refer to "Restarting a debugging session" on page 22. Searching for configuration files When you start Turbo Debugger, it looks for its configuration files in the following order: 1 In the current directory. 2 In the directory specified in the Turbo Directory setting of Turbo Debugger's installation program. 3 In the directory that contains the debugger's executable file. If Turbo Debugger finds a configuration file, the settings in that file override any built-in defaults. If you supply any command-line options when you start Turbo Debugger, they override any corresponding default options or values specified in the configuration file. 8 Turbo Debugger User's Guide
