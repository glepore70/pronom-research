EggPaint (or Egg Paint) is a raster image format used on Atari Falcon computers. It is presumably associated with a program called EggPaint, but information about such a program is hard to find.

It is a simple uncompressed format with 16 bits/pixel (RGB 5-6-5 format), and an 8-byte header. It is very similar to GodPaint format, and to Spooky Sprites TRP format.
