TextGrid file formats
This page describes the syntax and semantics of TextGrid files that Praat can read and/or write.

1. The full text format of a minimal TextGrid
If you record a Sound with a duration of 2.3 seconds, and then do To TextGrid..., you are asked to provide tier names and to say which of these tiers are point tiers. If you click OK without changing the settings from their standard values, you obtain a TextGrid with two interval tiers, called Mary and John, and one point tier called bell. When you save this TextGrid to disk by choosing Save as text file... from the New menu, the resulting text file, when opened in a text editor, will look as follows:

File type = "ooTextFile"
Object class = "TextGrid"
