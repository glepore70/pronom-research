TADS (Text Adventure Development System) is an Interactive Fiction development system by Michael J. Roberts. Plain text source code files are created using the TADS programming language, and then compiled into a system-independent game file. Compiled game files can be played on any system that has an appropriate interpreter.

/*
 *   Generate a filename for a character-set mapping file.  This function
 *   should determine the current native character set in use, if
 *   possible, then generate a filename, according to system-specific
 *   conventions, that we should attempt to load to get a mapping between
 *   the current native character set and the internal character set
 *   identified by 'internal_id'.
 *   
 *   The internal character set ID is a string of up to 4 characters.
 *   
 *   On DOS, the native character set is a DOS code page.  DOS code pages
 *   are identified by 3- or 4-digit identifiers; for example, code page
 *   437 is the default US ASCII DOS code page.  We generate the
 *   character-set mapping filename by appending the internal character
 *   set identifier to the DOS code page number, then appending ".TCP" to
 *   the result.  So, to map between ISO Latin-1 (internal ID = "La1") and
 *   DOS code page 437, we would generate the filename "437La1.TCP".
 *   
 *   Note that this function should do only two things.  First, determine
 *   the current native character set that's in use.  Second, generate a
 *   filename based on the current native code page and the internal ID.
 *   This function is NOT responsible for figuring out the mapping or
 *   anything like that -- it's simply where we generate the correct
 *   filename based on local convention.
