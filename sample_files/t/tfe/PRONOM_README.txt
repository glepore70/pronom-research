TFM Music Maker is a tracker-type music cross-editor for the TurboSound FM (TFM for short) - a sound expansion device for ZX Spectrum-compatible computers, developed and produced by NedoPC team. 

The editor allows to create, edit, and replay music for the TFM device using IBM PC-compatible computer with Windows. Music made in the editor can be replayed on the real device. With some limitations, the editor also can be used to make music for any other system with sound chip of the OPN family (YM2203, YM2608, YM2610, YM2612). The editor also has some features to simplify it's use to make music for FM-synth part of the Sega Genesis (Mega Drive) game console. 

The editor uses software emulation of YM2203 sound chip, based on source code from multi-system arcade machines emulator MAME.
