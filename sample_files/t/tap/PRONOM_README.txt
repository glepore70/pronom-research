Oric was the name used by UK-based Tangerine Computer Systems for a series of 6502-based home computers sold in the 1980s, primarily in Europe.

With the success of the ZX Spectrum from Sinclair Research, Tangerine's backers suggested a home computer and Tangerine formed Oric Products International Ltd to develop the Oric-1. The computer was introduced in 1982.[5] During 1983, approximately 160,000 Oric-1 computers were sold in the UK, plus another 50,000 in France (where it was the year's top-selling machine). This resulted in Oric being acquired and given funding for a successor model, the 1984 Oric Atmos.

Oric was bought by Eureka, which produced the less successful Oric Telestrat (1986). Oric was dissolved the year the Telestrat was released. Eastern European clones of Oric machines were produced into the 1990s.

TAP, or Oric Tape Format, is a tape image file format associated with the Oric 8-bit home computer system.

For the case where TAP is used as a graphics container format, see Oric HIRES screen.

Documentation says that files begin with some number (N) of bytes of value 0x16, followed by 0x24, where N is usually at least 8. But in actual files, N is observed to be 3 or 4.
