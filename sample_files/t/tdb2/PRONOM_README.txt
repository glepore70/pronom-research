TDB File Format
Tanner Database (TDB) is a proprietary, machine-readable format optimized for the Tanner Tools
environment. TDB files are saved with the .tdb filename extension. By default, the scrollable list
displays TDB files.
Along with the design itself, a TDB file contains setup information including layer rendering
information, CIF and GDSII setup information, design rules, and L-Edit configuration settings. Setup
information can be read into L-Edit with File > Replace Setup.
When a file is saved, L-Edit automatically backs up previously-saved versions of the file with a .tdo
extension.
