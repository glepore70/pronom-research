Hello everyone,
is there a way to view .T4G files?
And to convert this file in an exchange format such as: dxf / IGES?

Thanks in advance.
Greetings
Feyza :)

Hello Feyza,
what is the .T4G? do you have a small example

Is it possibly TG4 = Tiff G4?
Converting them to DXf or similar means vectorizing them. There are specialized suppliers, such as GTX, Softelec, Vectory.

Hello Feyza,
the file comes from CAD6 from Malz++Kassner ( http://www.malz-kassner.com   ) and is called TVG 4.5. There should be a DXF exporter for this, see also http://www.malz-kassner.de/solutionsoftware.htm   .

In any case, it is not such a common format that a standard viewer would read it.
