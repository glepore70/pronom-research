TNS File Format
.tns is the file format of the TI N-Spire documents. It contains several XML files, for more informations on its content: XML format used in TNS files. This page only discusses the .TNS file format itself.

History
The first tns files were standard zip files. Since OS 1.2, the format changed and the files stopped to be openable by zip utilities. If you are unfamiliar with the zip format, please refer to the official specification to better understand the following text.

The new format
It appears that the new format is just a zip file in disguise. It contains two differences which prevent utilities like the "file" command from detecting it.
