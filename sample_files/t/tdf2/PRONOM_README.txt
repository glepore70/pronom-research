SYSTEM TRACE UTILITIES

  Each FixPak installs version specific trace formatting (*.TFF) and
  definition files (*.TDF) in the \OS2\SYSTEM\TRACE directory.  If users
  service multiple versions of OS2 they may need to copy the *.TFF files
  to a private directory in order to allow a trace taken from another
  system version to format correctly.  The /T= parameter of TRACEFMT
  will allow the user to specify the TFF path from the command line. The
  TFF path may also be specified by selecting the File pull-down and Set
  TFF path option of TRACEFMT.
