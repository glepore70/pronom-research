TheDraw font files are used by the text and text-graphic editor TheDraw, used in the BBS era of the '80s and '90s to edit ASCII Art, ANSI Art, and other text-based files. The fonts are used to build large headline characters out of graphical characters such as line drawing characters found in the IBM PC code page.
