Information regarding InstallShield Redistributable Files for supported products

Synopsis
When you build releases in an InstallShield project, InstallShield includes various InstallShield redistributable files in the build output. You may use these InstallShield redistributable files in the build output according to the InstallShield End-User License Agreement. Most of these files are installed in the InstallShield Program Files Folder\Redist folder and included in builds as needed.

Following is a list of the InstallShield redistributable files for InstallShield 2012 Spring and earlier versions of InstallShield. For a list of the InstallShield redistributable files for newer versions of InstallShield, see "Shipping Redistributable Files" in the InstallShield Help Library that is installed with InstallShield.
