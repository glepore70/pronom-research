<title>TikTok Users Earned $500,000 Pushing Scam Apps - Until a 12-Year-Old Reported Them</title>

<description>An anonymous reader quotes CPO magazine:
An Avast report found that several popular TikTok profiles profited by pushing scam apps to underage children. At least three TikTok accounts with over 350,000 followers were implicated. The campaign involved at least seven scam apps distributed on both Google Play Store and Apple App Store. Users had downloaded the rogue apps more than 2.4 million times, earning the fraudsters more than $500,000. 

A 12-year old girl from the Czech Republic discovered a suspicious behavior on a popular app trending on TikTok and reported it to Avast. The child was a participant in the Avast's "Be Safe Online" cybersecurity initiative that teaches the youth how to identify cyber threats. Researchers at the cybersecurity firm investigated and found at least three TikTok profiles aggressively advertising scam apps to underage children. One of the TikTok profiles had more than 300,000 followers, while an Instagram account had more than 5,000 fans. Following the discovery, Avast researchers reported the scam apps to Google, Apple, Instagram, and TikTok... 

Avast reported that most of the scam apps promoted by the popular TikTok profiles were HiddenAd trojans. Such apps are disguised as useful software but served intrusive ads outside the app. They also hid app icons to prevent users from finding out the ads' source or uninstalling them.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

<title>Researchers Finally Measured Radiation Levels On the Moon. They're High.</title>
<link>http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/8ak7lajVaEM/researchers-finally-measured-radiation-levels-on-the-moon-theyre-high</link>
<description>Slashdot reader DevNull127 writes: Scientists were able to, for the first time, measure radiation levels on the lunar surface, reports UPI, and nine days ago they published their results: that the radiation levels on the moon are 200 times stronger than on earth &amp;mdash; and 2.6 times higher than those on space station. One of the scientists behind the study calls that exposure level "considerable." On the moon there's radiation from galactic cosmic rays, from solar particle events, and also a third component from the interaction of that radiation with the lunar soil. 
"We humans are not really made to withstand space radiation," study co-author Robert Wimmer-Schweingruber, a researcher at Kiel University in Germany, tells UPI. "However, astronauts can and should shield themselves as far as possible during longer stays on the moon, for example by covering their habitat with a thick layer of lunar soil." 
 Or, as Business Insider puts it, "Scientists say a lunar base should be built underground to protect astronauts." Wimmer-Schweingruber tells them that "If you think about people staying on the moon for extended periods of time &amp;mdash; say, on a scientific research station for a year or two &amp;mdash; then these levels start getting problematic. Covering your habitat with sufficient amounts of lunar dirt should do the trick.... Ideally you'd like to be under as much material as is equivalent to Earth's atmosphere," Wimmer-Schweingruber said, adding that "an optimal depth is 30 inches of lunar soil."&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

<title>Facebook Leak Shows Its Preparations to Fight a Government-Ordered Breakup</title>
<link>http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/5fA1bd6yV3o/facebook-leak-shows-its-preparations-to-fight-a-government-ordered-breakup</link>
<description>Engadget reports:

Facebook is under intense regulatory pressure, and it appears to be bracing itself for the worst. The Wall Street Journal says it has obtained a document outlining Facebook's defense if the government orders a breakup that would unload Instagram and WhatsApp. The social media giant would reportedly argue that a split would be a "complete nonstarter" based on officials' past actions &amp;mdash; or lack thereof. 

According to the leak, Facebook would contend that its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp passed FTC scrutiny without objections, leading it to pour massive amounts of money into both projects as it integrated them into its operations. A breakup would require spending billions and running separate systems that reduced security and hurt the user experience, Facebook would claim. 


Facebook has declined to comment on the apparent leak. In the past, it has pushed for extra regulation (albeit limited) in place of a breakup.

<title>'Google and Facebook's Ad Business Might Not Survive Amazon'</title>
<link>http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/HCv_kHEXnA0/google-and-facebooks-ad-business-might-not-survive-amazon</link>
<description>"There's a relatively new, rapidly growing player in the online advertising world," warns Medium's new consumer technology site Debugger &amp;mdash; taking a close look at the "Sponsored Products" listed first in the results of Amazon searches. 

"Given its unique business model, its history of swallowing whole industries, and its sheer size, Amazon has the potential to massively disrupt the online ad world &amp;mdash; and forever change tech."

The success of online ads depends on how close a user is to buying something... Few companies, though, are more intimately connected to peoples' buying behaviors than Amazon. As of mid-2020, Amazon controlled nearly 40% of American e-commerce, and data from 2018 suggests that it may control as much as 94% in certain categories, like cosmetics and batteries. Overall, the company is forecast to control almost 5.5% of all retail in America in 2020 &amp;mdash; especially as Covid-19 has forced consumers to do more of their shopping online... 

And the ads are cheap. For one campaign, I paid just $249 to show my ad to 1,049,000 people. Ads are cheap because Amazon has a vested interest in driving more sales. The company collects a commission of between 6% and 20% on every item sold through the site. For every product I sold through a Sponsored Products campaign, Amazon was effectively getting paid twice &amp;mdash; once for running the ad, and again for managing the sale of my product. This likely allows them to keep ad rates lower than those charged by their competitors. Ad prices may also be low because Amazon's ad program has relatively little overhead. To understand what you mean by the query "Lunch," Google has to run a massive, worldwide data-gathering program that peers into every aspect of your online and offline life, from the websites you visit to the humidity level in your home. That's expensive. In contrast, when you type something into an e-commerce platform like Amazon, you're telling the company exactly what you want to buy &amp;mdash; no world-spanning surveillance program needed. Amazon has recently expanded its advertising program to Twitch (which Amazon owns), giving marketers the option to target the platform's younger audience... 


In building AWS, Amazon also essentially ate Microsoft's lunch, stealing an industry it was expected to dominate right out from under it. By moving into the advertising world, Amazon could well do the same thing for ad-funded giants like Google, Twitter, and Facebook. Advertising is largely a zero-sum game &amp;mdash; the ad dollars currently flowing to Google and Facebook come largely at the expense of newspaper, magazine, and television ads. If the dollars start flowing to Amazon instead, the other tech giants could see a massive drop in their bottom lines. 

That would have big ramifications for the advertising industry. But it would have an even bigger impact on tech. More than 70% of Google's revenue comes from ads. For Facebook, that number is 98.5%... [I]f Amazon decides to take on Google and Facebook directly, it could result in a fight that saps the strength of both tech giants, and ultimately kills off the emerging companies that rely on them for funding and talent. The impact on the tech industry could be massive, world-changing &amp;mdash; and permanent.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

<title>Tech's New Gig Worker Underclass: Customer Service Reps Who Have to Pay to Talk to You</title>
<link>http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/XX9Zs3cVPPc/techs-new-gig-worker-underclass-customer-service-reps-who-have-to-pay-to-talk-to-you</link>
<description>The Pulitzer prize-winning news nonprofit Propublica looks at Arise Virtual Solutions, part of the secretive world of work-at-home customer service companies that help large corporations shed costs at the expense of workers. And thanks to the pandemic, "business is booming."

Arise lines up customer service agents who work from home. It then sells this network of agents to blue-chip corporations. Arise and most of its corporate clients consider preserving the secrecy of this arrangement to be vital... Arise's workers not only don't work for its clients, they also don't officially work for Arise. Like Uber drivers or TaskRabbit gofers, they are independent contractors. To get gigs, they first absorb substantial expense, paying for their own equipment and training, and then have fees deducted from every paycheck for the "use" of Arise's "platform." 

Arise has faced, and lost, legal challenges alleging that its arrangements with agents violate federal labor law and cheat workers of what they are rightfully owed. One judge called the arrangement an "elaborate construct" created by Arise to get around labor law. Nevertheless Arise has been able to avoid altering its model in any significant way, aided in part by a 5-4 ruling from the Supreme Court... 

With American roots going back to the 1990s, Arise's list of corporate clients, past and present, includes not only Airbnb, Comcast, Instacart and Disney, but also Amazon, Apple and AT&amp;amp;T. There's also Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, eBay, Intuit, Home Depot, Staples, Princess Cruises, Peloton, Signet Jewelers, Virgin Atlantic and Walgreens... 

Many agents find that the pay, after the cost of training and fees to Arise, dips well below minimum wage. 
Ironically, the historic Marxist song of the international workers movement began with the lyric, "Arise ye workers from your slumbers. Arise ye prisoners of want...."&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

<title>The Free Software Foundation Wants You To Celebrate Its 35th Anniversary</title>
<link>http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/10iQIX-3100/the-free-software-foundation-wants-you-to-celebrate-its-35th-anniversary</link>
<description>"Today, on October 4th, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) celebrates its thirty-fifth year of fighting for software freedom," announces a blog post at FSF.org:
Our work will not be finished until every computer user is able to do all of their digital tasks in complete freedom &amp;mdash; whether that's on a desktop, laptop, or the computer in your pocket. The fight for free software continues, and we wouldn't be here without you. 

To celebrate, we have a full week of announcements and surprises planned starting today, and we will end in an online anniversary event featuring both live and prerecorded segments this Friday, October 9th, from 12:00 EDT (16:00 UTC) until 17:00 EDT (21:00 UTC). We'd love for you to join in celebration of this amazing community by submitting a short (two-minute) video sharing your favorite memory about free software or the FSF, and a wish for the future of software freedom. We'll be collecting the videos all week and airing a selection during the birthday event on October 9th... 

If you are able to, please make a donation of $35 or more to help keep the fight for user freedom going another 35 years, we'll send you a commemorative pin... We're another year older, but that doesn't mean we're slowing down our efforts to bring software freedom to users around the globe. Stay tuned for more information on how we plan to ring in the FSF's next year, and the vital role each one of us plays in ensuring free software's success for the future. We hope that you'll be able to take part in our festivities this week! 

The announcement suggests 10 different ways to celebrate, which include:

 Try a fully free distribution of GNU/Linux, which can be run "live" without making any permanent changes to your computer's hard drive. Take an hour to follow our Email Self-Defense Guide, and learn how to opt out of bulk surveillance . Download and experiment with one of the oldest parts of the GNU operating system, the GNU Emacs text editor. Try the tutorial by launching the editor and typing Ctrl-h + t (C-h t), or see if you can make it through some of the games included with Emacs, such as Alt-x (M-x) dunnet or M-x tetris. Make the commitment to replace one nonfree program that you use with one that respects your freedom, such as using LibreOffice instead of Microsoft Office. Petition the administrators of your favorite Web site to free the proprietary JavaScript lurking on their page that many users run and download without ever realizing it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

<title>Twitter Hashtag For Far-Right Group Taken Over By Gay Men</title>
<link>http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/DMk8moIij9A/twitter-hashtag-for-far-right-group-taken-over-by-gay-men</link>
<description>"The Proud Boys hashtag, which members of the far-right group have been using, was trending Sunday," reports CNN, "after gay men on Twitter hijacked it and flooded the feed with photos of their loved ones and families and with memes." 

On Thursday 83-year-old George Takei (who'd play Sulu, the helmsman of the starship Enterprise, on the original Star Trek TV series) had suggested the hijacking to his 3.1 million followers on Twitter &amp;mdash; and CNN describes what happened next:
Matt Dechaine, one of the men who pitched in with photos of himself and his husband in efforts to overtake the hashtag, said his goal was simply to spread joy. "Seeing the hashtag was so uplifting," Dechaine, who is from England, told CNN. "It feels like the movement for positive change for all is gathering momentum all the time and I'm glad to be a small part of it. By coming together rooted in respect and love for each other, the world can be so much better!" 

But Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys, said he doesn't see what the men are trying to accomplish. "I think it's hysterical," Tarrio told CNN. "This isn't something that's offensive to us. It's not an insult. We aren't homophobic. We don't care who people sleep with. People think it's going to bother us. It doesn't."&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

<title>Is Streaming Music Worse For the Environment?</title>
<link>http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/qbrdg8MA9Ik/is-streaming-music-worse-for-the-environment</link>
<description>"The environmental cost of music is now greater than at any time during recorded music's previous eras," argues Kyle Devine, in his recent book, "Decomposed: The Political Ecology of Music." 

The New Yorker's music critic writes:

He supports that claim with a chart of his own devising, using data culled from various sources, which suggests that, in 2016, streaming and downloading music generated around a hundred and ninety-four million kilograms of greenhouse-gas emissions &amp;mdash; some forty million more than the emissions associated with all music formats in 2000... Exploitative regimes of labor enable the production of smartphone and computer components. Conditions at Foxconn factories in China have long been notorious; recent reports suggest that the brutally abused Uighur minority has been pressed into the production of Apple devices. Child laborers are involved in the mining of cobalt, which is used in iPhone batteries. Spotify, the dominant streaming service, needs huge quantities of energy to power its servers. No less problematic are the streaming services' own exploitative practices, including their notoriously stingy royalty payments to working musicians... 

When the compact disk entered circulation, in the nineteen-eighties, audio snobs attacked it as a degradation of listening culture &amp;mdash; a descent from soulful analog sound to soulless digital. In environmental terms, however, the CD turned out to be somewhat less deleterious [than vinyl records]. Devine observes that polycarbonate, the medium's principal ingredient, is not as toxic as polyvinyl chloride. Early on, the widespread use of polystyrene for CD packaging wiped out that advantage, but a turn toward recyclable materials in recent years has made the lowly CD perhaps the least environmentally harmful format on the market. 
In a chapter on the digital and streaming era, Devine drives home the point that there is no such thing as a nonmaterial way of listening to music: "The so-called cloud is a definitely material and mainly hardwired network of fiber-optic cables, servers, routers, and the like." This concealment of industrial reality, behind a phantasmagoria of virtuality, is a sleight of hand typical of Big Tech, with its genius for persuading consumers never to wonder how transactions have become so shimmeringly effortless. In much the same way, it has convinced us not to think too hard about the regime of mass surveillance on which the economics of the industry rests.... At the end of "Decomposed," Devine incorporates his ecology of music into a more comprehensive vision of anthropogenic crisis. "Musically, we may need to question our expectations of infinite access and infinite storage," he writes. Our demand that all of musical history should be available at the touch of a finger has become gluttonous. It may seem a harmless form of consumer desire, but it leaves real scars on the face of the Earth.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

<title>Battery Drain Problems After iPhone Upgrade? Apple Suggests Complete Data Wipe</title>
<link>http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/tur6q232Qk8/battery-drain-problems-after-iphone-upgrade-apple-suggests-complete-data-wipe</link>
<description>Apple has confirmed several problems including "increased battery drain" for some users who upgraded their iPhone to iOS 14. But ZDNet warns Apple's proposed solution "sounds pretty drastic."
 Forbes reports:
In an official post, Apple reveals seven significant data and battery-related problems with iOS 14 and watchOS 7, and the company states the only fix is to "erase all content and settings from your iPhone". 

Breaking these down, Apple classifies six as related to its Activity, Health and Fitness apps as well as the broader problem of "Increased battery drain on your iPhone or Apple Watch." The latter will not be a surprise to anyone who has seen the growing number of complaints directed at the company's @AppleSupport Twitter account since iOS 14 was released... 

On the plus side, Apple's belief that these problems can be fixed without an iOS update is good news. That said, a complete data wipe is also the nuclear option, so Apple is not messing around... I would also be amazed if iOS 14.0.2 is not being fast tracked as we speak.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

<title>Some Coronavirus Vaccine Trials Resort To Pen and Paper After Ransomware Hits Software</title>
<link>http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/UJDR-IXYV24/some-coronavirus-vaccine-trials-resort-to-pen-and-paper-after-ransomware-hits-software</link>
<description>A software company supporting hundreds of clinical trials &amp;mdash; including coronavirus vaccine trials &amp;mdash; has been hit by a ransomware attack that "has slowed some of those trials over the past two weeks," reports the New York Times. 
Employees "discovered that they were locked out of their data by ransomware..."

eResearchTechnology (ERT) said clinical trial patients were never at risk, but customers said the attack forced trial researchers to track their patients with pen and paper. Among those hit were IQVIA, the contract research organization helping manage AstraZeneca's Covid vaccine trial, and Bristol Myers Squibb, the drugmaker leading a consortium of companies to develop a quick test for the virus. ERT has not said how many clinical trials were affected, but its software is used in drug trials across Europe, Asia and North America. It was used in three-quarters of trials that led to drug approvals by the Food and Drug Administration last year, according to its website. 

On Friday, Drew Bustos, ERT's vice president of marketing, confirmed that ransomware had seized its systems on September 20. As a precaution, Mr. Bustos said, the company took its systems offline that day, called in outside cybersecurity experts and notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation. "Nobody feels great about these experiences, but this has been contained," Mr. Bustos said. He added that ERT was starting to bring its systems back online on Friday and planned to bring remaining systems online over the coming days... 

One of ERT's clients, IQVIA, said it had been able to limit problems because it had backed up its data. Bristol Myers Squibb also said the impact of the attack had been limited, but other ERT customers had to move their clinical trials to move to pen and paper.
 
The Times notes it's just one of "more than a thousand ransomware attacks on American cities, counties and hospitals over the past 18 months." Other interesting details from the article:

 ERT's vice president of marketing "declined to say whether the company paid its extortionists, as so many companies hit by ransomware now do."

 The attack follows what NBC News calls "one of the largest medical cyberattacks in United States history," taking down the computer systems of Universal Health Services at over 400 locations.

 "In May, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security warned that Chinese government spies were actively trying to steal American clinical research through cybertheft... More than a dozen countries have redeployed military and intelligence hackers to glean what they can about other nations' responses, according to security researchers."
 Two companies working on a coronavirus vaccine &amp;mdash; Pfizer and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson &amp;mdash; emphasized to the Times that they weren't affected by ERT's issues, with a Pfizer spokesperson stressing they're not even using ERT's software.

At a Canadian recycling firm hired by Apple to scrap about 600,000 Apple devices, 100,000 of them were actually resold to other companies that made working devices from the parts. 
Apple now sues the recycling company for the money made from the sale plus 31 million Canadian dollars. The recycling company claims that the devices were resold by three rogue employees that pocketed the profits. 
The re-sold devices included iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches, according to news reports, and though they were being re-sold in China, Apple still complains that at least 18% of the devices they'd shipped to the company they later found active on wireless carrier networks. 

Apple also says the re-sales dampened demand for new Apple products, hurt their brand by keeping products intended for destruction out on the market &amp;mdash; and created a safety issue for consumers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

<title>51% of Developers Say They're Managing 100 Times More Code Than a Decade Ago</title>

<description>An anonymous reader quotes Ars Technica:

Sourcegraph, a company specializing in universal code search, polled more than 500 North American software developers to identify issues in code complexity and management. Its general findings are probably no surprise to most Ars readers &amp;mdash; software has gotten bigger, more complex, and much more important in the past ten years &amp;mdash; but the sheer scope can be surprising... When asked how the size of the codebase across their entire company, measured in megabytes and the number of repositories, has changed in the past decade, over half (51%) of software development stakeholders reported they have more than 100 times the volume of code they had 10 years ago. And a staggering 18% say they have 500 times more code. 

Ars also reports another surprising finding: 91% of the surveyed developers said their non-technology company "functions more like a technology company than it did ten years ago. 

"This won't surprise anyone who has noticed firms like Walmart Labs sponsoring open source technology conferences and delivering presentations."&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

<title>Google Patches ChromeOS Update Bug That Caused 100% CPU Usage</title>
<link>http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/8wCAhceqVik/google-patches-chromeos-update-bug-that-caused-100-cpu-usage</link>
<description>"Hello Chrome OS Community," posted one of Google's community managers Wednesday. "Thank you for raising this issue, and for your patience as we work to resolve this. Our team has identified the issue and is rolling out a fix to affected devices." 

The issue? ChromeOS users reported the latest updates "cause a Google Play Store service to utilize 100 percent of their CPUs..." according to TechRadar, "making their devices hot and leading to performance issues."
As reported by BleepingComputer, after upgrading their devices to ChromeOS version 85.0.4183.108 and later users have faced a number of issues including apps that are running erratically, devices getting hot, fans running at high speed and batteries draining much too quickly. Upon investigating these issues further, users discovered that they were caused by the Google Play 'com.android.vending:download_service' utilizing 95 to 100 percent of their devices CPU for an extended period. This service is used to download new updates from the Google Play Store when they become available. However, a bug in the service causes the CPU to run at 100 percent power all of the time even when a new update is not available. 

Bleeping Computer reported last Sunday that the issues didn't affect all Chromebooks, but was reported by users of Acer Chromebooks, ASUS Chromebook Flip, and Galaxy Chromebooks. "One user stated they resolved this issue by rolling back to an older Google Play Store version."&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

<title>After 'No Time To Die' Postponement, Hundreds of US and UK Movie Theatres Postpone Reopening </title>

<description>An anonymous reader quotes the Hollywood Reporter:

Following the delay of more Hollywood tentpoles &amp;mdash; including James Bond film No Time to Die &amp;mdash; mega-movie theater chain Cineworld is planning to keep all of its locations in the U.K. and the U.S. closed for the time being, The Sunday Times reported on Saturday. 

The British-based company is the largest circuit in the U.K with more than 120 sites, and the second-largest in North America, where it operates roughly 540 locations under the Regal Cinemas banner. A substantial number of these theaters hadn't yet reopened after forced to go dark because of the coronavirus pandemic. 

Across Hollywood, the surprise Saturday-night headline prompted immediate concern that AMC Theatres and Cinemark Theates could soon follow suit. 

Variety reports:
In the U.K., Cineworld, which declined to comment, is understood to be writing to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden this weekend to explain that the exhibition sector is "unviable" due to studios delaying tentpoles as a result of anxious audiences steering clear of cinemas amid the global pandemic. The Cineworld closures will put up to 5,500 jobs at risk in the U.K. Sources indicate a reopening date hasn't yet been set, but cinemas could stay closed until 2021.... 
The delay is major blow to theaters, and there's a chance more could be forced to close given the lack of new content on the horizon. Pixar's "Soul" on Nov. 20 is now the next big movie slated for theatrical release. However, there are rumblings that Disney will move the animated adventure and possibly even put it on Disney Plus, the studio's subscription streaming service. Two Warner Bros. titles, "Wonder Woman 1984" and "Dune," are still set for December, though there's a chance those could be postponed again as well.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

<title>ZDNet Argues Linux-Based Windows 'Makes Perfect Sense'</title>
<link>http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/kY18kwU2TFY/zdnet-argues-linux-based-windows-makes-perfect-sense</link>
<description>Last week open-source advocate Eric S. Raymond argued Microsoft was quietly switching over to a Linux kernel that emulates Windows.
"He's on to something," says ZDNet's contributing editor Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols:
I've long thought that Microsoft was considering migrating the Windows interface to running on the Linux kernel. Why...? [Y]ou can run standard Linux programs now on WSL2 without any trouble. 

That's because Linux is well on its way to becoming a first-class citizen on the Windows desktop. Multiple Linux distros, starting with Ubuntu, Red Hat Fedora, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop (SLED), now run smoothly on WSL2. That's because Microsoft has replaced its WSL1 translation layer, which converted Linux kernel calls into Windows calls, with WSL2. With WSL2 Microsoft's own Linux kernel is running on a thin version of the Hyper-V hypervisor. That's not all. With the recent Windows 10 Insider Preview build 20211, you can now access Linux file systems, such as ext4, from Windows File Manager and PowerShell. On top of that, Microsoft developers are making it easy to run Linux graphical applications on Windows... 

[Raymond] also observed, correctly, that Microsoft no longer depends on Windows for its cash flow but on its Azure cloud offering. Which, by the way, is running more Linux instances than it is Windows Server instances. So, that being the case, why should Microsoft keep pouring money into the notoriously trouble-prone Windows kernel &amp;mdash; over 50 serious bugs fixed in the last Patch Tuesday roundup &amp;mdash; when it can use the free-as-in-beer Linux kernel? Good question. He thinks Microsoft can do the math and switch to Linux. 

I think he's right. Besides his points, there are others. Microsoft already wants you to replace your existing PC-based software, like Office 2019, with software-as-a-service (SaaS) programs like Office 365. Microsoft also encourages you to move your voice, video, chat, and texting to Microsoft's Azure Communication Services even if you don't use Teams. With SaaS programs, Microsoft doesn't care what operating system you're running. They're still going to get paid whether you run Office 365 on Windows, a Chromebook, or, yes, Linux. 

I see two possible paths ahead for Windows. First, there's Linux-based Windows. It simply makes financial sense. Or, the existing Windows desktop being replaced by the Windows Virtual Desktop or other Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS) offerings.... Google chose to save money and increase security by using Linux as the basis for Chrome OS. This worked out really well for Google. It can for Microsoft with &amp;mdash; let's take a blast from the past &amp;mdash; and call it Lindows as well.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;
