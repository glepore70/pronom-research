Abstract: Objectives. This case-control study investigated risk factors for campylobacteriosis in a rural population. Exposure to live farm animals was hypothesized to increase the risk for Campylobacter jejuni enteritis. Methods. Incident cases from rural counties reported to the Michigan Department of Community Health and matched controls completed a self-administered postal questionnaire. Results. Persons engaged in poultry husbandry had increased odds of campylobacteriosis (odds ratio = 6.884; 95% confidence interval CI) = 1.438, 32.954). There was evidence for a dose-response relationship between the number of types of poultry contact and campylobacteriosis. Conclusions. We estimate that 18% (95% CI = 6%, 30%) of Campylobacter cases occurring in rural populations are attributable to poultry husbandry. Cases occurred in individuals who were not poultry farmers by occupation.

Abstract: A fundamental change in the theory underlying public health and medicine is needed. Latin American social medicine (LASM), originating in a region of the world that has been subjected to colonial and postcolonial influence, will be part of this change. To the extent that the social production of disease among people in other regions is a consequence of various large-scale forms of domination, LASM offers a relevant analysis, models of resistance, and exemplars of social medicine in practice. I draw upon LASM to examine the social production of disease in the Marshall Islands and Iraq. I suggest a basis for a global social medicine in the shared experience of suffering and describe implications for public health theory and practice.

Abstract: We conducted a bibliometric and content analysis of research on health inequalities produced in Latin American and Caribbean countries. In our bibliometric analysis (n=576), we used indexed material published between 1971 and 2000. The content analysis (n=269) covered the period 1971 to 1995 and included unpublished material. We found recent rapid growth in overall output. Brazil, Chile, and Mexico contributed mostly empirical research, while Ecuador and Argentina produced more conceptual studies. We found, in the literature reviewed, a relative neglect of gender, race, and ethnicity issues. We also found remarkable diversity in research designs, however, along with strong consideration of ecological and ethnographic methods absent in other research traditions.

Abstract: Objectives. This study sought to describe the evolution of the Russian compulsory health insurance system and to identify factors associated with noncoverage. Methods. Data from successive waves of the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (1992-2000) were analyzed. Results. Insurance coverage grew rapidly throughout the 1990s, although 11.8% of the country's citizens were still uninsured by 2000. Coverage initiation rates were greater at first among citizens who were better off, but this gap closed over the study period. Among individuals of working age, coverage rates diminished with age and were lower for the unemployed, for the self-employed, and for those residing outside Moscow or St. Petersburg. Conclusions. The growth of insurance coverage in Russia slowed toward the end of the 1990s, and gaps remain. Achievement of universal coverage will require new, targeted policies.

Abstract: Objectives. The authors evaluated the impact of state adult protective service legislation on rates of investigated and substantiated domestic elder abuse. Methods. Data were collected on all domestic elder abuse reports, investigations, and substantiations for each US state and the District of Columbia for 1999. State statutes and regulations pertaining to adult protective services were reviewed. Results. There were 190005 domestic elder abuse reports from 17 states, a rate of 8.6 per 1000 elders; 242430 domestic elder abuse investigations from 47 states, a rate of 5.9; and 102879 substantiations from 35 states, a rate of 2.7. Significantly higher investigation rates were found for states requiring mandatory reporting and tracking of numbers of reports. Conclusions. Domestic elder abuse documentation among states shows substantial differences related to specific aspects of state laws.

Abstract: Mercury is a growing environmental threat that can cause serious health problems and birth defects. Household thermometers are high-risk sources of mercury because most people lack the knowledge to properly dispose of one when it is broken. The Boston Public Health Commission's Environmental Health Office, with local and national partners, created the Boston Mercury Thermometer Exchange Program to address this hazard. Large central exchanges are successful, but multiple smaller targeted "microexchanges" can be another effective way to reach the general public and specific vulnerable subpopulations such as the elderly, the homebound disabled, or recent immigrants. By conducting exchanges in community health centers and public housing developments for the elderly and disabled, and by working through home health care providers, the program collected 4477 thermometers.

Abstract: Objectives. Healthy People 2010: Understanding and Improving Health lists 6 areas of disparity in minority health services: infant mortality, cancer, cardiovascular disease, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, and immunizations. This study compiles existing Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) health data to establish a baseline. Methods. For federally-sponsored research (1986-2000), the Computer Retrieval of Information on Specific Projects (CRISP) database was analyzed. AAPI initiatives were divided by subpopulation and disparity area. MEDLINE articles (1966-2000) were similarly scrutinized. Results. Few federal health-related grants (0.2%) and MEDLINE articles (0.01%) mention AAPIs. For the 6 disparity areas, significant AAPI data gaps remain. Conclusions. To reach the Healthy People 2010 goals and have useful data, researchers and grant makers must focus on obtaining baseline data for disaggregated AAPI subgroups.

Pages: 2028-2031
Abstract: Latin American social medicine (LASM) emerged as a movement in the 1970s and played an important role in the Brazilian health care reform of the 1980s, both of which focused on decentralization and on health care as a social right. The dominant health care reform model in Latin America has included a market-driven, private subsystem for the insured and a public subsystem for the uninsured and the poor. In contrast, the Mexico City government has launched a comprehensive policy based on social rights and redistribution of resources. A universal pension for senior citizens and free medical services are financed by grants, eliminating routine government corruption and waste. The Mexico City policy reflects the influence of Latin American social medicine. In this article, I outline the basic traits of LASM and those of the prevailing health care reform model in Latin America and describe the Mexico City social and health policy, emphasizing the influence of LASM in values, principles, and concrete programs.

Abstract: Objectives. We studied the impact of globalization on the making of health policy. Globalization is understood as economic interdependence among nations. The North American Free Trade Agreement is used as a marker to assess the effects of economic interdependence on binational health cooperation along the United States-Mexico border. Methods. We observed participants and conducted in-depth interviews with policy-makers, public health specialists, representatives of professional organizations, and unions. Results. Globalization has not promoted binational health policy cooperation. Barriers that keep US and Mexican policymakers apart prevail while health problems that do not recognize international borders go unresolved. Conclusions. If international health problems are to be solved, political, cultural, and social interdependence need to be built with the same impetus by which policymakers promote international trade.

Abstract: Violence is the main public health problem in Colombia. Many theoretical and methodological approaches to solving this problem have been attempted from different disciplines. My past work has focused on homicide violence from the perspective of social medicine. In this article I present the main conceptual and methodological aspects and the chief findings of my research over the past 15 years. Findings include a quantitative description of the current situation and the introduction of the category of explanatory contexts as a contribution to the study of Colombian violence. The complexity and severity of this problem demand greater theoretical discussion, more plans for action and a faster transition between the two. Social medicine may make a growing contribution to this field.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined racial and ethnic disparities in analgesic prescription among a national sample of emergency department patients. Methods. We analyzed Black, Latino, and White patients in the 1997-1999 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys to compare prescription of any analgesics and opioid analgesics by race/ethnicity. Results. For any analgesic, no association was found between race and prescription; opioids, however, were less likely to be prescribed to Blacks than to Whites with migraines and back pain, though race was not significant for patients with long bone fracture. Differences in opioid use between Latinos and Whites with the same conditions were less and nonsignificant. Conclusions. Physicians were less likely to prescribe opioids to Blacks; this disparity appears greatest for conditions with fewer objective findings (e.g., migraine).

Abstract: Objectives. This study identified predictors of patient choice of a primary care medical doctor or chiropractor for treatment of low back pain. Methods. Data from initial visits were derived from a prospective, longitudinal, nonrandomized, practice-based observational study of patients who self-referred to medical and chiropractic physicians (n = 1414). Results. Logistic regression showed differences between patients who sought care from medical doctors vs chiropractors in terms of patient health status, sociodemographic characteristics, insurance, and attitudes. Disability, insurance, and trust in provider types were particularly important predictors. Conclusions. The study highlights the importance of patient attitudes, health status, and insurance in self-referral decisions. The significance of patient attitudes suggests that education might be used to shape attitudes and encourage cost-effective care choices.

Abstract: Latin American social medicine arose during the 1950s and 1960s, drawing its inspiration from the social movements that emerged in France, Germany, and England in the mid-19th century. The Latin American movement of social medicine has clear ideological goals. It is organized around the Latin American Association of Social Medicine, which was founded in 1984 and is regarded as a social, political, and academic movement. This article takes a historical perspective and presents the reasons for the emergence and identity of the association, focusing on the main developments and contributions of this movement from the 1990s until the present time.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to separate age and cohort associations with depression, assessed 3 times within a 10-year period in 701 women born between 1928 and 1958. Methods. We used regression analysis to examine age differences in women with depression in 2 birth cohorts, pre-1945 and post-1944, who were assessed at comparable ages. Multilevel modeling was used to estimate changes with age in successive birth year cohorts. Results. An age by cohort interaction indicated more depression among younger than older women in the post-1944 cohort but a flat age profile in the pre-1945 cohort. Longitudinal analyses indicated declines in depression with age in more recent cohorts but increases in earlier ones. Conclusions. Increases in depression in younger women in successive cohorts may be offset by decreases in middle age.

Abstract: Objectives. The authors assessed the effects of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) on the development of asthma in adults. Methods. In the Pirkanmaa district of South Finland, all 21- to 63-year-old adults with new cases of asthma diagnosed during a 2.5-year period (n=521 case patients, out of 441000 inhabitants) and a random sample of control subjects from the source population (932 control subjects) participated in a population-based incident case-control study. Results. Risk of asthma was related to workplace ETS exposure (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=2.16; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.26, 3.72) and home exposure (OR =4.77; 95% CI=1.29, 17.7) in the past year. Cumulative ETS exposure over a lifetime at work and at home increased the risk. Conclusions. This study indicates for the first time that both cumulative lifetime and recent ETS exposures increase the risk of adult-onset asthma.

Abstract: The medical community has orchestrated breastfeeding campaigns in response to low breastfeeding rates twice in US history. The first campaigns occurred in the early 20th century after reformers linked diarrhea, which caused the majority of infant deaths, to the use of cows' milk as an infant food. Today, given studies showing that numerous diseases and conditions can be prevented of limited in severity by prolonged breastfeeding, a practice shunned by most American mothers, the medical community is again inaugurating efforts to endorse breastfeeding as a preventive health measure. This article describes infant feeding practices and resulting public health campaigns in the early 20th and 21st centuries and finds lessons in the original campaigns for the promoters of breastfeeding today.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined preventive care delivered in Manitoba during the 1990s by 3 different methods - childhood immunizations (by physicians and public health nurses under a government program), screening mammography (through a government program introduced in 1995), and cervical cancer screening (no program). Methods. Longitudinal administrative data, an immunization monitoring system, and Canadian census databases were used. Results. Cervical cancer screening rates remained static and showed strong socioeconomic differences; childhood immunization rates remained high with small socioeconomic gradients. The introduction of the Manitoba Breast Screening Program resulted in rising rates of screening and vanishing socioeconomic gradients. Conclusions. Manitoba government programs in childhood immunization and screening mammography actively helped the provision of preventive care. Organized programs that target population groups, recognize barriers to access, and facilitate self-evaluation are critical for equitable delivery.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the effect of race, socioeconomic status, and health insurance status on the prevalence of overweight among children and adolescents. Methods. We studied an observational cohort from the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Household Component. Results. In the younger group, both Black and Latino children had a greater likelihood of being overweight compared with White children. Among the adolescent group, Latinos and Asian/Pacific Islanders were more likely to be overweight. Among adolescents, lacking health insurance and having public insurance were both positively associated with the prevalence of overweight. A relationship between insurance status and overweight was not observed for younger children. Conclusions. There are substantial racial differences in the prevalence of overweight for children and adolescents. Health insurance status is associated with the prevalence of overweight among adolescents.

Data from subjects aged 12 to 17 years (n = 26536; 50.4% male) from the California Tobacco Survey and the California Youth Tobacco Survey were analyzed, and never smokers were used as the outcome measure. Results. The proportion of never smokers increased from 60% for males and 66% for females in 1990 to around 70% for both sexes in 1999. Respondents were more likely to be never smokers if born in 1978 or later (i.e., aged 12 years or younger in 1990, when most tobacco control programs started in California). Conclusions. The statewide antitobacco programs prevented adolescents from starting to smoke, primarily through a cohort effect.

Abstract: Objectives. This study identified racial/ethnic disparities in influenza vaccination in high-risk adults. Methods. We analyzed data on influenza vaccination in 7655 adults with high-risk conditions, using data from the 1999 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). We stratified data by age and used multiple logistic regression to adjust for gender, education, income, employment, and health care access. Results. After control for covariates, White patients with diabetes, chronic heart conditions, and cancer had a higher prevalence of influenza vaccination than did Black patients with the same conditions. Similarly, White patients with 2 or more high-risk conditions were more likely to receive the influenza vaccine than Black patients with the same conditions. Conclusions. Significant racial/ethnic differences exist in influenza vaccination of high-risk individuals, and missed vaccination opportunities seem to contribute to the less-than-optimal influenza vaccination coverage in the United States.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the prevalence and correlates of substance use, dependence, and service utilization among uninsured persons aged 12 to 64 years. Methods. We drew study data from the 1998 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. Results. An estimated 80% of uninsured nonelderly persons reported being uninsured for more than 6 months in the prior year. Only 9% of these uninsured persons who were dependent on alcohol or drugs had received any substance abuse service in the past year. Non-Hispanic Whites were an estimated 3 times more likely than Blacks to receive substance abuse services. Conclusions. Compared with the privately insured, uninsured persons had increased odds of having alcohol/drug dependence and appeared to face substantial barriers to health services for substance use problems.

Abstract: Objectives. We evaluated female-condom use among women participating in an HIV/STD intervention designed to reduce unprotected sex and expand prevention strategies. Methods. Women (n=360) were recruited from a family-planning clinic and were randomized into an 8- or 4-session intervention group or a control group. We conducted follow-up interviews at 1, 6, and 12 months. Results. At 1 month, the odds ratios of first-time female-condom use were 9.49 (95% confidence interval [CI]=4.01, 22.20) in the 8-session group and 4.39 (95% CI=1.84, 10.49) in the 4-session group relative to controls. Repeated use (n=21) was predicted by perceived ability to use, by self and partner satisfaction, by dislike of male condoms, and by previous diaphragm use. Conclusions. Gender sensitive cognitive-behavioral interventions can influence women to try the female condom. To increase long-term use, interventions may need to include self-insertion practice and involvement of male partners.

Abstract: Objectives. This study compared the health and risk status of adolescents who identify with 1 race with those identifying with more than 1 race. Methods. Data are derived from self-reports of race, using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), which provides a large representative national sample of adolescents in grades 7 through 12. Respondents could report more than 1 race. Results. Mixed-race adolescents showed higher risk when compared with single-race adolescents on general health questions, school experience, smoking and drinking, and other risk variables. Conclusions. Adolescents who self-identify as more than 1 race are at higher health and behavior risks. The findings are compatible with interpreting the elevated risk of mixed race as associated with stress.

Abstract: Objectives. There has been a growing recognition of the importance of contextual influences on health outcomes. This article examines community-level influences on 5 reproductive wellness outcomes in Uttar Pradesh, India. Methods. Multilevel modeling is used to estimate household and community-level effects on wellness, with hierarchically organized data from a statewide survey of villages, urban blocks, households, women, health providers, and staff. Results. The household and community have a strong contextual influence on wellness, although the models explain more of the variation in outcomes between households than between communities. Conclusions. Communities influence wellness outcomes through the socioeconomic environment and the characteristics of the health infrastructure. The specific dimensions of the community and health infrastructure varied between the outcomes.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to characterize substance use patterns in young men who have sex with men (MSM) in 7 US urban areas and sociodemographic characteristics and history associated with such use. Methods. We examined data collected from 1994 through 1998 in a venue-based, cross-sectional survey. Results. Among the 3492 participants, 66% reported use of illicit drugs; 28%, use of 3 or more drugs; 29%, frequent drug use (once a week or more); and 4%, injection drug use. These practices were more common among participants who were White, self-identified as bisexual or heterosexual, had run away, or had experienced forced sex. Conclusions. Effective drug prevention and treatment programs addressing local drug-use patterns and associated factors are urgently needed for young MSM, a population with a high rate of illicit drug use.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the standard compliance protocol and its validity as a measure of youth access to tobacco. Methods. In Study 1, youth smokers reported buying cigarettes in stores where they are regular customers. In Study 2, youths attempted to purchase cigarettes by using the Standard Protocol, in which they appeared at stores once for cigarettes, and by using the Familiarity Protocol, in which they were rendered regular customers by purchasing nontobacco items 4 times and then requested cigarettes during their fifth visit. Results. Sales to youths aged 17 years in the Familiarity Protocol were significantly higher than sales to the same age group in the Standard Protocols (62.5% vs. 6%, respectively). Conclusions. The Standard Protocol does not match how youths obtain cigarettes. Access is low for stranger youths within compliance studies, but access is high for familiar youths outside of compliance studies.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined whether colleges with larger enrollments of students from demographic groups with lower rates of binge drinking exert a moderating effect on students from groups with higher binge drinking rates. Methods. The study analyzed data from 114 colleges included in the 1993, 1997, 1999, and 2001 College Alcohol Study surveys. Results. The binge drinking rates of White, male, and underage students were significantly lower in schools that had more minority, female, and older students. Students who do not binge drink in high school are more likely to start binge drinking at colleges with fewer minority and older students. Conclusions. Student-body composition and demographic diversity should be examined by colleges wishing to reduce their binge drinking problems.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the public health impact of the socioeconomic status (SES) gradient on adolescents' physical and mental health. Methods. Population attributable risk (PAR) for household income and parental education were calculated relative to depression and obesity among a nationally representative sample of 15112 adolescents. Results. PARs for income and education were large. Across each gender and race/ ethnicity group, the PAR for education tended to exceed that for income. For depression, the adjusted PAR for income was 26%, and the PAR for education was 40%; for obesity, the adjusted PAR for income was 32%, and the PAR for education was 39%. Conclusions. SES is associated with a large proportion of the disease burden within the total population.

Title: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Evolution of Abortion Policy, 1951-1973: The Politics of Science

Volume: 93

Pages: 1810-1819
Abstract: The autonomy granted to physicians is based on the claim that their decisions are grounded in scientific principles. But a case study of the evolution of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' abortion policy between 1951 and 1973 shows that decisions were only secondarily determined by science. The principal determinant was the need to preserve physician autonomy over the organization and delivery of services. As a result, the organization representing physicians who specialized in women's reproductive health was marginal to the struggle for legalized abortion. But, the profession was central to decisions about whether physicians would perform abortions and how they would be done. This case study finding has implications for understanding the role that organized medicine might take in the ongoing debates about national health policy.

Abstract: Objectives. The author investigated the willingness of the general public to pay for domestic violence prevention programs. Methods. An experimental design was used in a telephone survey of 522 California adults. One of 11 funding methods and one of 4 dollar amounts were randomly assigned to each respondent. Results. Most respondents (79.4%) reported support for domestic violence prevention programming. They were most willing to pay $5 or less via "user fees" (e.g., increased fines for batterers) and humanitarian "donations" (e.g., sales of special postage stamps). Conclusions. Health departments that want to increase their domestic violence prevention programming need to identify widely accepted methods by which funds can be raised. The methods used here can be applied to numerous public health activities and issues.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined antimicrobial prescribing patterns for adults and children with bronchitis or upper respiratory infections (URIS) before and after release of nationally disseminated pediatric practice recommendations. Methods. Data from the 1993, 1995, 1997, and 1999 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were used to evaluate prescriptions for antimicrobials for URIs and bronchitis. Results. From 1993 to 1999, the proportion of children receiving antimicrobials after visits for URIs and bronchitis decreased. However, the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials rose from 10.6% of bronchitis visits to 40.5%. Prescriptions of antimicrobials for adults with URIs or bronchitis showed a decrease between 1993 and 1999. Conclusions. Although antimicrobial prescribing for URIs and bronchitis has decreased for both children and adults, the prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics among children has shown a proportional rise.

Abstract: Objectives. We describe the tobacco industry's effort in Massachusetts to block the adoption of local regulations designed to reduce youth access to tobacco products. We also explain how state-funded tobacco control advocates overcame industry opposition. Methods. We examined internal tobacco industry documents and records of local boards of health and conducted interviews with participants in local regulatory debates. Results. The industry fought proposed regulations by working through a trade group, the New England Convenience Store Association. With industry direction and financing, the association's members argued against proposed regulations in local public hearings. However, these efforts failed because community-based advocates worked assiduously to cultivate support for the regulations among board of health members and local community organizations. Conclusions. Passage of youth access regulations by local boards of health in Massachusetts is attributed to ongoing state funding for local tobacco control initiatives, agreement on common policy goals among tobacco control advocates, and a strategy of persuading boards of health to adopt and enforce their own local regulations.

Abstract: Objectives. We evaluated ethical constraints concerning youth surveys on child sexual abuse (CSA). Methods. We reviewed internationally published studies and Danish regulations concerning school-based surveys conducted without active parental consent. Results. Ethical constraints concerning participants in youth community studies have been scantily assessed. Danish legislation accords minors the right to be heard on issues concerning themselves. The anticipated societal benefits of children's participation in community studies justify conducting anonymous surveys among schoolchildren based upon their own informed consent. Conclusions. No ethical or legal objections were found to conducting an anonymous survey in Denmark on CSA among 9th-grade pupils without parental consent, provided that the survey was accompanied by an offer of counseling.

Abstract: Objectives. The United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) policy encourages foster care during refugee emergencies. We examined evidence to support this policy using data from the 1994 Rwandan refugee crisis. Methods. The association of weight gain and acute illness with family status (foster children vs children living with their biological families) was examined using latent growth curve and repeated measures logistic regression analysis. Results. Weight gain for all children averaged 0.40 kg/month and was associated with child's age but not with family status, child's or caregiver's sex, caregiver's marital status, possession of blankets or plastic sheeting, severe malnutrition, month of enrollment, or acute illness. Illness was not more common among foster children than among children living with their biological families. Conclusions. This analysis supports the UNHCR/UNICEF recommendation of fostering for unaccompanied children during an acute refugee crisis.

Abstract: Objectives. We estimated racial/ethnic differences in rates of major depression and investigated possible mediators. Methods. Depression prevalence rates among African American, Hispanic, and White adults were estimated from a population-based national sample and adjusted for potential confounders. Results. African Americans (odds ratio [OR]=1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.93, 1.44) and Hispanics (OR=1.44, 95% CI=1.02, 2.04) exhibited elevated rates of major depression relative to Whites. After control for confounders, Hispanics and Whites exhibited similar rates, and African Americans exhibited significantly lower rates than Whites. Conclusions. Major depression and factors associated with depression were more frequent among members of minority groups than among Whites. Elevated depression rates among minority individuals are largely associated with greater health burdens and lack of health insurance, factors amenable to public policy intervention.

Abstract: Objectives. We studied the association between early life conditions and asthma in adolescence. Methods. We conducted a population-based birth cohort study involving 2250 male 18-year-olds residing in Brazil. Results. Approximately 18% of the adolescents reported having asthma. Several childhood factors were found to be significantly associated with increased asthma risk: being of high socioeconomic status, living in an uncrowded household, and children being breastfed for 9 months or longer. Conclusions. The present results are consistent with the "hygiene hypothesis," according to which early exposure to infections provides protection against asthma. The policy implications of our findings are unclear given that risk factors for asthma protect against serious childhood diseases in developing countries.

Abstract: Objectives. Our study tested the effectiveness of network methods for identifying opinion leaders and for constructing groups. Methods. Three conditions-random, teacher, and network-were randomly assigned to 84 6th-grade classrooms within 16 schools. Pre- and postcurriculum data on mediators of tobacco use were collected from 1961 students. Peer leaders in the network condition were identified by student nominations, and those leaders were matched with the students who nominated them. Results. Students in the network condition relative to the random condition liked the prevention program more and had improved attitudes (β=-0.06; P<.01), improved self-efficacy (β=-0.10; P<.001), and decreased intention to smoke (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.38, 0.55). Conclusions. The network method was the most effective way to structure the program. Future programs may refine this technique and use it in other settings.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to determine the efficacy of coaching Latino adolescents with latent tuberculosis infection to adhere to isoniazid treatment. Methods. Participants (n=286) were randomly assigned to adherence coaching, attention control, or usual care groups. Adherence was measured via interviews and validated with urine assays. Results. Coaching resulted in significant increases in adherence compared with attention and usual care groups. Bicultural adolescents were more likely to be adherent than those most or least acculturated. Age and risk behavior were negatively related to adherence. Conclusions. Coaching can increase Latino adolescents' adherence to treatment for latent tuberculosis infection and should contribute to tuberculosis control for adolescents at high risk of contracting the disease.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the relationship between burden of providing care to non-ill children and grandchildren and incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) among women. Methods. A prospective cohort study was conducted as part of the Nurses' Health Study among 54 412 women aged 46 to 71 years who were registered nurses. Women answered questions about their child care responsibilities. Results. We documented 321 incident cases of CHD during 4 years of follow-up. Multivariate analyses showed that caring for non-ill children 21 hours or more per week and caring for non-ill grandchildren 9 hours or more per week (vs no caregiving) were associated with an increased risk of CHD (relative risks were 1.59 and 1.55, respectively). Conclusions. High levels of care provision to grandchildren (and possibly children) may increase the risk of CHD among women.

We used a self-administered classroom questionnaire; questions addressed general health, health care, nutrition, sexual history, drug use, mental health, violence, family characteristics, and relationships with others. Results. Most youths reported good health; however; 1 in 10 reported a limiting disability or significant health problems. Violence was a pervasive concern. Of those who reported history of sexual intercourse, many reported that their first intercourse was forced, and nearly half reported that they were aged 10 years or younger when they first had intercourse. Conclusions. Although most young people are healthy, problems indicate the importance of monitoring trends and designing effective youth health programs.

Abstract: Objectives. We evaluated the revised Project ALERT drug prevention program across a wide variety of Midwestern schools and communities. Methods. Fifty-five South Dakota middle schools were randomly assigned to program or control conditions. Treatment group students received 11 lessons in 7th grade and 3 more in 8th grade. Program effects for 4276 8th-graders were assessed 18 months after baseline. Results. The revised Project ALERT curriculum curbed cigarette and marijuana use initiation, current and regular cigarette use, and alcohol misuse. Reductions ranged from 19% to 39%. Program effects were not significant for initial and current drinking or for current and regular marijuana use. Conclusions. School-based drug prevention programs can prevent occasional and more serious drug use, help low- to high-risk adolescents, and be effective in diverse school environments.

Abstract: Objectives. This study sought to examine the expectations and satisfaction of pastors and lay leaders regarding a research partnership in a randomized trial guided by community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods. Methods. Telephone and self-administered print surveys were administered to 78 pastors and lay leaders. In-depth interviews were conducted with 4 pastors after study completion. Results. The combined survey response rate was 65%. Research expectations included honest and frequent communication, sensitivity to the church environment, interaction as partners, and results provided to the churches. Satisfaction with the research partnership was high, but so was concern about the need for all research teams to establish trust with church partners. Conclusions. Pastors and lay leaders have high expectations regarding university obligations in research partnerships. An intervention study based on CBPR methods was able to meet most of these expectations.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to examine whether physician recommendations for cardiac revascularization vary according to patient race. Methods. We studied patients scheduled for coronary angiography at 2 hospitals, one public and one private, between November 1997 and June 1999. Cardiologists were interviewed regarding their recommendations for cardiac resvacularization. Results. African American patients were less likely than Whites to be recommended for revascularization at the public hospital (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.12, 0.77) but not at the private hospital (adjusted OR=1.69; 95% CI=0.69, 4.14). Conclusions. Physician recommendations for cardiac revascularization vary by patient race. Further studies are needed to examine physician bias as a factor in racial disparities in cardiac care and outcomes.

Title: Restrictions on Undocumented Immigrants' Access to Health Services: The Public Health Implications of Welfare Reform

Author-Name: Kullgren, J.T.
Year: 2003
Volume: 93
Issue: 10
Pages: 1630-1633
Abstract: The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 greatly restricts the provision of many federal, state, and local public services to undocumented immigrants. These restrictions have prompted intense debates about the provision of free and discounted primary and preventive health care-services and have placed significant burdens on institutions that serve large undocumented immigrant populations. Intended to serve as a tool for reducing illegal immigration and protecting public resources, federal restrictions on undocumented immigrants' access to publicly financed health services unduly burden health care providers and threaten the public's health. These deleterious effects warrant the public health community's support of strategies designed to sustain provision of health services irrespective of immigration status.

Abstract: Objectives. This study sought to describe the health status, health insurance, and health care utilization patterns of the growing population of immigrant Black men. Methods. We used data from the 1997-2000 National Health Interview Survey to examine and then compare health variables of foreign-born Black men with those of US-born Black and White men. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine health outcomes. Results. Foreign-born Black men were in better overall health than their US-born Black counterparts and were much less likely than either US-born Black or White men to report adverse health behaviors. Despite these health advantages, foreign-born Black men were more likely than either US-born Black or White men to be uninsured. Conclusions. In the long term, immigrant Black men who are in poor health may be adversely affected by lack of health care coverage.

Abstract: American Indian tribal clinics hired benefits counselors to increase the number of patients with public and private insurance coverage, expand the range of health care options available to tribal members, and increase third-party revenues for tribal clinics. Benefits counselors received intensive training, technical assistance, and evaluation over a 2-year period. Six tribal clinics participated in the full training program, including follow-up, process evaluation, and outcomes reporting. Participating tribal sites experienced a 78% increase in Medicaid enrollment among pregnant women and children, compared with a 26% enrollment increase statewide during the same period. Trained benefits counselors on-site at tribal clinics can substantially increase third-party insurance coverage among patients.

Abstract: Objectives. We identified race-associated differences in survival among HIV-positive US veterans to examine possible etiologies for these differences. Methods. We used national administrative data to compare survival by race and used data from the Veterans Aging Cohort 3-Site Study (VACS 3) to compare patients' health status, clinical management, and adherence to medication by race. Results. Nationally, minority veterans had higher mortality rates than did white veterans with HIV. Minority veterans had poorer health than white veterans with HIV. No significant differences were found in clinical management or adherence. Conclusions. HIV-positive minority veterans experience poorer survival than white veterans. This difference may derive from differences in comorbidities and in the severity of illness of HIV-related disease.

Abstract: Use of multilevel frameworks and area-based socioeconomic measures (ABSMs) for public health monitoring can potentially overcome the absence of socioeconomic data in most US public health surveillance systems. To assess whether ABSMs can meaningfully be used for diverse race/ethnicity-gender groups, we geocoded and linked public health surveillance data from Massachusetts and Rhode Island to 1990 block group, tract, and zip code ABSMs. Outcomes comprised death, birth, cancer incidence, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, childhood lead poisoning, and nonfatal weapons-related injuries. Among White, Black, and Hispanic women and men, measures of economic deprivation (e.g., percentage below poverty) were most sensitive to expected socioeconomic gradients in health, with the most consistent results and maximal geocoding linkage evident for tract-level analyses.

Abstract: In many ministries of health, applied epidemiology and training programs (AETPs) are responsible for detecting and responding to acute health events, including bioterrorism. In November 2001, we assessed the bioterrorism response capacity of 29 AETPs; 17 (59%) responded. Fifteen countries (88%) had bioterrorism response plans; in 6 (40%), AETPs took the lead in preparation and in 6 (40%) they assisted. Between September 11 and November 29, 2001, 12 AETPs (71%) responded to a total of 3024 bioterrorism-related phone calls. Six programs (35%) responded to suspected bioterrorism events. AETPs play an important role in bioterrorism surveillance and response. Support for this global network by various health agencies is beneficial for all developed and developing countries.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined agreement of administrative data with self-reported race/ethnicity and identified correlates of agreement. Methods. We used Veterans Affairs administrative data and VA 1999 Large Health survey race/ethnicity data. Results. Relatively low rates of agreement (approximately 60%) between data sources were largely the result of administrative data from patients whose race/ethnicity was unknown, with least agreement for Native American, Asian, and Pacific Islander patients. After exclusion of patients with missing race/ethnicity, agreement improved except for Native Americans. Agreement did not increase substantially after inclusion of data from individuals indicating multiple race/ethnicities. Patients for whom there was better agreement between data sources tended to be less educated, non-solitary living, younger, and White; to have sufficient food; and to use more inpatient Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) care. Conclusions. Better reporting of race/ethnicity data will improve agreement between data sources. Previous studies using VA administrative data may have underestimated racial disparities.

Using data from 4685 individuals in the Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes (TRIAD) Study, a multicenter study of diabetes care in managed care, we constructed multivariate regression models to compare health behaviors, processes of care, and intermediate outcomes for Whites and English- and Spanish-speaking Latinos. Results. Latinos had lower rates of self-monitoring of blood glucose and worse glycemic control than did Whites, higher rates of foot self-care and dilated-eye examinations, and comparable rates of other processes and intermediate outcomes of care. Conclusions. Although self-management and quality of care are comparable for Latinos and Whites with diabetes, important ethnic disparities persist in the managed care settings studied.

Abstract: Objectives. We evaluated the effects of socioeconomic status and comorbidity on stage of disease and survival among 1,509 population-based prostate cancer patients. Methods. We applied logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression to data from Whites, African Americans, and Asian Americans who were diagnosed from 1987 to 1991. Results. Patients with existing comorbid conditions were less likely than those without these conditions to be diagnosed with advanced cancer. Compared with Whites, African Americans (odds ratio [OR] = 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1, 2.2) and foreign-born Asian Americans (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.0, 2.4) were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer. Among men with localized disease, prostate cancer death rates were higher for African Americans than for Whites (death rate ratio = 2.3; 95% CI = 1.2, 4.7). Conclusions. These findings support the need for further investigation of factors that affect access to and use of health care among African Americans and Asian Americans.

Abstract: Foreign-born persons from countries where tuberculosis (TB) is endemic make up a significant percentage of poultry industry workers in Delaware, a leading poultry-producing state. Many of these workers enter the United States without documentation and assume multiple identities, making it difficult for public health staff to investigate TB contacts who work in the poultry plants. The Sussex County Health Unit of the Delaware Division of Public Health developed a no-name TB tracking system to facilitate identification and treatment of poultry plant workers with TB infection and disease in a high-risk population whose members assume one or more aliases. Completion rates for treatment of latent TB infection in this group increased from 48% to 64% 2 years after the program's implementation.

Abstract: Objectives. This study explored whether racial differences in patient-physician relationships contribute to disparities in the quality of health care. Methods. We analyzed data from The Commonwealth Fund's 2001 Health Care Quality Survey to determine whether racial differences in patients' satisfaction with health care and use of basic health services were explained by differences in quality of patient-physician interactions, physicians' cultural sensitivity, or patient-physician racial concordance. Results. Both satisfaction with and use of health services were lower for Hispanics and Asians than for Blacks and Whites. Racial differences in the quality of patient-physician interactions helped explain the observed disparities in satisfaction, but not in the use of health services. Conclusions. Barriers in the patient-physician relationship contribute to racial disparities in the experience of health care.

Abstract: Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is an approach to research and evaluation that is receiving increased attention in the field of public health. Our report discusses the application of this approach to research and evaluation with an Early Head Start (EHS) program in Pittsburgh, Pa. Our primary purpose is to illustrate the key elements that contributed to effective collaboration among researchers, EHS practitioners, and parents of EHS children in the conduct of the study. The focus is not on research findings but on research process. Our goal is to make the practices of CBPR visible and explicit so they can be analyzed, further developed, and effectively applied to a range of public health issues in a diversity of community contexts.

Abstract: During World War II, the US Public Health Service (USPHS) administered health care to 19 000 enemy aliens and Axis merchant seamen interned by the Justice Department through its branch, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The Geneva Prisoners of War Convention of 1929, which the United Status applied to civilian internees, provided guidelines for belligerent nations regarding humanitarian treatment of prisoners of war, including for their health. The INS forged an agreement with the USPHS to meet these guidelines for the German, Italian, and Japanese internees and, in some cases, their families. Chronic shortages and crowded camps continuously challenged USPHS administrators. Nevertheless, the USPHS offered universal access to care and provided treatment often exceeding care received by many American citizens.

Abstract: Objectives. We designed and evaluated interventions to increase adult immunizations within inner-city health centers. Methods. Interventions included reminders, standing orders, and walk-in "flu shot clinics." Patients were surveyed and records evaluated. Results. Records from 1 center showed that immunization rates increased from 24% to 30% (P<.001) for patients aged 50 to 64 years and from 45% to 53% for patients aged 65 years and older (P<.001). Self-reported vaccination rates did not increase. In logistic regression analyses, the strongest predictor of vaccination among patients aged 50 to 64 years was the belief that unvaccinated persons will contract influenza (odds ratio [OR]=5.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.4, 12.0). Among patients aged 65 years and older, the strongest predictor of vaccination was the belief that friends/relatives thought that they should be vaccinated (OR=9.7; 95% CI=4.2, 22.3). Conclusions. Tailored interventions can improve immunization rates at inner-city health centers.

Abstract: Objectives. We compared patterns of mortality among men with prostate cancer at 2 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and 2 private-sector hospitals in the Chicago area. Methods. Mortality rates for 864 cases diagnosed between 1986 and 1990 were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models that incorporated age; income; cancer stage, differentiation, and treatments; and baseline comorbidity. Results. Race tended to associate with all-cause mortality irrespective of health care setting (Blacks vs Whites: hazard rate ratio [HRR] = 1.68 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.06, 2.67]; P < .001 in the private sector; HRR = 1.50 [95% CI = 0.94, 2.38]; P = .088 in the VA). However, comorbidity determined risk in the VA, whereas age and income predicted risk in the private sector. Conclusions. Determinants of all-cause mortality in men with prostate cancer vary according to health care setting.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined occupational risks for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and soft-tissue sarcoma among African American and White men. Methods. Race-specific multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted using data from a large US population-based case-control study. Results. Significant occupational risks were limited to African Americans; chromium was associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (odds ratio [OR] = 3.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2, 12.9) and wood dust was associated with Hodgkin's disease (OR = 4.6, 95% CI = 1.6, 13.3) and soft-tissue sarcoma (OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.6, 8.6). Conclusions. Race-specific occupational risk factors for cancer were evident only among African American men. This may reflect racial disparities in levels of exposure to occupational carcinogens.

Pages: 1395-1399
Abstract: Urban form, the law, and health are undoubtedly linked. However, nonlegal factors such as 20th-century reliance on the automobile as well as associated governmental actions and private investment choices have greatly influenced urban form, especially urban sprawl. The American system of federalism, with its traditional allocation of land-use legal authority to local governments, and resulting fragmented legal authority over causes and effects of urban sprawl, renders difficult legal efforts to reshape urban form. Legal frameworks and the dynamics and effects of urban sprawl are largely mismatched. Still, existing legal frameworks and modest legal reforms provide means to encourage or at least allow urban forms that are more conducive to health. However, the law will not easily transform urban form and deter urban sprawl.

Abstract: Mounting evidence suggests physical and mental health problems relate to the built environment, including human-modified places such as homes, schools, workplaces, parks, industrial areas, farms, roads and highways. The public health relevance of the built environment requires examination. Preliminary research demonstrates the health benefits of sustainable communities. However, the impact of mediating and moderating factors within the built environment on health must be explored further. Given the complexity of the built environment, understanding its influence on human health requires a community-based, multilevel, interdisciplinary research approach. The authors offer recommendations, based upon a recent conference sponsored by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), for research and policy approaches, and suggest interagency research alliances for greater public health impact.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the effects of sprawl, or conventional development, versus managed (or "smart") growth on land and infrastructure consumption as well as on real estate development and public service costs in the United States. Methods. Mathematical impact models were used to produce US estimates of differences in resources consumed according to each growth scenario over the period 2000-2025. Results. Sprawl produces a 21% increase in amount of undeveloped land converted to developed land (2.4 million acres) and approximately a 10% increase in local road lane-miles (188300). Furthermore, sprawl causes about 10% more annual public service (fiscal) deficits ($4.2 billion) and 8% higher housing occupancy costs ($13000 per dwelling unit). Conclusions. Managed growth can save significant amounts of human and natural resources with limited effects on traditional development procedures.

Abstract: Objectives. I sought to examine whether pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use neighborhoods encourage enhanced levels of social and community engagement (i.e., social capital). Methods. The study investigated the relationship between neighborhood design and individual levels of social capital. Data were obtained from a household survey that measured the social capital of citizens living in neighborhoods that ranged from traditional, mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented designs to modern, car-dependent suburban subdivisions in Galway, Ireland. Results. The analyses indicate that persons living in walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods have higher levels of social capital compared with those living in car-oriented suburbs. Respondents living in walkable neighborhoods were more likely to know their neighbors, participate politically, trust others, and be socially engaged. Conclusions. Walkable, mixed-use neighborhood designs can encourage the development of social capital.

Abstract: Objectives. This study sought to examine individual, social environmental, and physical environmental correlates of walking. Methods. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among healthy workers and home-makers residing in metropolitan Perth, Western Australia. Results. Most respondents walked for transport or recreation, but only 17.2% did a sufficient amount of walking to accrue health benefits. After adjustment, the relative influences of individual, social environmental, and physical environmental factors were found to be almost equally important. Conclusions. Although walking is popular, few people do enough walking to benefit their health. Those who walk as well as engage in other physical activities appear more likely to achieve recommended levels of activity, Promoting walking may require a comprehensive strategy.

Abstract: The Reasonable Person Model is a conceptual framework that links environmental factors with human behavior. People are more reasonable, cooperative, helpful, and satisfied when the environment supports their basic informational needs. The same environmental supports are important factors in enhancing human health. We use this framework to identify the informational requirements common to various health-promoting factors that are realizable through well-designed physical environments. Environmental attractors, support of way-finding, and facilitation of social interaction all contribute to the health-relevant themes of community, crime, and mode of transportation. In addition, the nearby natural environment, although often neglected, can serve as a remarkably effective resource.

We offer an overview of nearly a century of research directed at understanding indoor environments and health, consider current research needs, and set out policy matters that need to be addressed if we are to have the healthiest possible built environments. The policy context for built environments extends beyond health considerations to include energy use for air-conditioning, selection of materials for sustainability, and design for safety, security, and productivity.

Abstract: We sought to characterize and to evaluate the success of current public health interventions related to housing. Two reviewers content-analyzed 72 articles selected from 12 electronic databases of US interventions from 1990 to 2001. Ninety-two percent of the interventions addressed a single condition, most often lead poisoning, injury, or asthma. Fifty-seven percent targeted children, and 13% targeted seniors. The most common intervention strategies employed a one-time treatment to improve the environment; to change behavior, attitudes, or knowledge; or both, Most studies reported statistically significant improvements, but few (14%) were judged extremely successful. Current interventions are limited by narrow definitions of housing and health, by brief time spans, and by limited geographic and social scales, An ecological paradigm is recommended as a guide to more effective approaches.

We reviewed the literature to determine how land use regulations can function as control tools for public health advocates. We found that land use regulations are a public health advocacy tool that has been successfully used to lessen the negative effects of alcohol retail outlets in neighborhoods. More research is needed to determine whether such regulations are successful in reducing the negative effects of other retail outlets on community health.

Abstract: We provide a brief critical review and assessment of engineering modifications to the built environment that can reduce the risk of pedestrian injuries. In our review, we used the Transportation Research Information Services database to conduct a search for studies on engineering counter-measures documented in the scientific literature. We classified countermeasures into 3 categories-speed control, separation of pedestrians from vehicles, and measures that increase the visibility and conspicuity of pedestrians. We determined the measures and settings with the greatest potential for crash prevention. Our review, which emphasized inclusion of studies with adequate methodological designs, showed that modification of the built environment can substantially reduce the risk of pedestrian-vehicle crashes.

Abstract: Objectives. The health consequences of neighborhood poverty are a public health problem. Data were obtained to examine links between neighborhood residence and mental health outcomes. Methods. Moving to Opportunity was a randomized, controlled trial in which families from public housing in high-poverty neighborhoods were moved into private housing in near-poor or nonpoor neighborhoods, with a subset remaining in public housing. At the 3-year follow-up of the New York site, 550 families were reinterviewed. Results. Parents who moved to low-poverty neighborhoods reported significantly less distress than parents who remained in high-poverty neighborhoods. Boys who moved to less poor neighborhoods reported significantly fewer anxious/ depressive and dependency problems than did boys who stayed in public housing. Conclusions. This study provides experimental evidence of neighborhood income effects on mental health.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the extent to which schools in the United States have health-promoting policies, programs, and facilities. Methods. We analyzed data from the School Health Policies and Programs Study 2000. Results. We found that public schools (vs private and Catholic schools), urban schools (vs rural and suburban schools), and schools with larger enrollments (vs smaller schools) had more health-promoting policies, programs, and facilities in place. On average, middle schools had 11.0 and middle/junior and high schools had 10.4 out of a possible 18 policies, programs, and facilities. Conclusions. Although some schools had many healthy physical environment feature, room for improvement exists. Resources are available to help schools improve their health-promoting policies, programs, and facilities.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to determine the association between urban sprawl and traffic fatalities. Methods. We created a sprawl index by applying principal components analysis to data for 448 US counties in the largest 101 metropolitan areas. Regression analysis was used to determine associations between the index and traffic fatalities. Results. For every 1% increase in the index (i.e., more compact, less sprawl), all-mode traffic fatality rates fell by 1.49% (P<.001) and pedestrian fatality rates fell by 1.47% to 3.56%, after adjustment for pedestrian exposure (P<001). Conclusions. Urban sprawl was directly related to traffic fatalities and pedestrian fatalities. Subsequent studies should investigate relationships at a finer geographic scale and should strive to improve on the measure of exposure used to adjust pedestrian fatality rates.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the public health consequences of unsafe and inconvenient walking and bicycling conditions in American cities to suggest improvements based on successful policies in The Netherlands and Germany. Methods. Secondary data from national travel and crash surveys were used to compute fatality trends from 1975 to 2001 and fatality and injury rates for pedestrians and cyclists in The Netherlands, Germany, and the United States in 2000. Results. American pedestrians and cyclists were much more likely to be killed or injured than were Dutch and German pedestrians and cyclists, both on a per-trip and on a per-kilometer basis. Conclusions. A wide range of measures are available to improve the safety of walking and cycling in American cities, both to reduce fatalities and injuries and to encourage walking and cycling.

Pages: 1564-1569
Abstract: Objectives. I analyzed traffic fatalities and homicides related to leaving home for routine activities, and considered connections between these fatalities and the built environment. Methods. I analyzed city, county, state, and federal data for traffic fatalities and homicides by strangers for 15 metropolitan areas, and classified deaths as occurring in the central city, in inner suburbs, or in outer suburbs (exurbs). Results. Traffic fatality rates were highest in exurban areas. Combined traffic fatality and homicide-by-stranger rates were higher in some or all outer counties than in central cities or inner suburbs in all of the metropolitan areas studied. Conclusions. Traffic fatalities are largely unrecognized as a danger to be factored into residential location decisions. Land use controls that deter sprawl along narrow exurban roads can reduce the mortality risks associated with leaving home.

Abstract: Some claim that car-dependent cities contribute to obesity by discouraging walking and bicycling. In this article, we use household activity data from the San Francisco region to study the links between urban environments and nonmotorized travel. We used factor analysis to represent the urban design and land-use diversity dimensions of built environments. Combining factor scores with control variables, like steep terrain, that gauge impediments to walking and bicycling, we estimated discrete-choice models. Built-environment factors exerted far weaker, although not inconsequential, influences on walking and bicycling than control variables. Stronger evidence on the importance of urban landscapes in shaping foot and bicycle travel is needed if the urban planning and public health professions are to forge an effective alliance against car-dependent sprawl.

Abstract: The built environment significantly affects the public's health. This was most obvious when infectious disease was the primary public health threat during the industrial revolution; unsanitary conditions and overcrowded urban areas facilitated the spread of infection. However, even today in the age of chronic diseases there remains an important connection between population health and the built environment. Physical spaces can expose people to toxins or pollutants and influence lifestyles that contribute to diabetes, coronary vascular disease, and asthma. Public health advocates can help shape the design of cities and suburbs in ways that improve public health, but to do so effectively they need to understand the legal framework. This article reviews the connection between public health and the built environment and then describes the legal pathways for improving the design of our built environment.

Abstract: Objectives. This study evaluated a neighborhood environment survey and compared the physical activity and weight status of the residents in 2 neighborhoods. Methods. On 2 occasions, 107 adults from neighborhoods with differing "walkability" were selected to complete a survey on their neighborhood environment. Physical activity was assessed by self-report and by accelerometer; height and weight were assessed by self-report. Results. Neighborhood environment characteristics had moderate to high test-retest reliabilities. Residents of high-walkability neighborhoods reported higher residential density, land use mix, street connectivity, aesthetics, and safety. They had more than 70 more minutes of physical activity and had lower obesity prevalence (adjusted for individual demographics) than did residents of low-walkability neighborhoods. Conclusions. The reliability and validity of self-reported neighborhood environment subscales were supported. Neighborhood environment was associated with physical activity and overweight prevalence.

Abstract: Deteriorating physical features of urban environments can negatively influence public health. Dilapidated environments and urban blight tend to promote alienation and can be associated with social disorder, vandalism, crime, drug abuse, traffic violations, and littering, which in turn affects health and well-being. In the late 1990s, the Sunnyside neighborhood in Portland, Ore, was plagued by many of these problems. In an attempt to invigorate neighborhood stewardship, the community organized and created a public gathering place; together, they painted a gigantic sunflower in the middle of an intersection and installed several interactive art features. As a result of these collective actions of "place-making," social capital has increased, thus revitalizing the community, and expanded social networks among residents have stimulated a sense of well-being.

Abstract: Objectives. This study measured the extent to which land use, design, and engineering practices could reduce contamination of major public water supplies. Methods. Key parcels of land were identified in New Jersey, and the potential uncontrolled loading of contaminants was estimated with the US Environmental Protection Agency's Long-Term Hydrologic Impact Assessment model for a variety of land use, design, and engineering scenarios. Results. High-density per-acre development and engineering controls, along with housing and light commercial activity near main railroads, would substantially reduce runoff. Conclusions. In New Jersey, government and purveyor action is being taken as a result of, and in support of, these findings.

Abstract: In this article, I trace the history of Chicago's Health Department, exploring when and how housing conditions come to be considered a serious social problem requiring municipal regulation. Although journalists and labor leaders were among the first Chicagoans to link tenement housing to the spread of contagious disease, Health Department officials quickly began regulating the city's housing stock under under their own authority. I argue that in attempting to eliminate the dangers of contagious disease, a long-standing public health threat, health officials drew new attention to the dangers of multifamily dwellings and set a precedent for government regulation of living conditions in tenement dwellings.

Abstract: Objectives. This study investigated the scale of the public health risk from stormwater runoff caused by urbanization. Methods. We compiled turbidity data for municipal treated drinking water as an indication of potential risk in selected US cities and compared estimated costs of waterborne disease and preventive measures. Results. Turbidity levels in other US cities were similar to those linked to illnesses in Milwaukee, Wis, and Philadelphia, Pa. The estimated annual cost of waterborne illness is comparable to the long-term capital investment needed for improved drinking water treatment and stormwater management. Conclusions. Although additional data on cost and effectiveness are needed, stormwater management to minimize runoff and associated pollution appears to make sense for protecting public health at the least cost.

Abstract: Population growth and the proliferation of roadways in Southern California have facilitated a glut of mobile air pollution sources (cars and trucks), resulting in substantial atmospheric pollution. Despite successful efforts over the past 40 years to reduce pollution, an alarming set of health effects attributable to air pollution have been described in Southern California. The Children's Health Study indicates that reduced lung function growth, increased school absences, asthma exacerbation, and new-onset asthma are occurring at current levels of air pollution, with sizable economic consequences. We describe these findings and urge a more aggressive effort to reduce air pollution exposures to protect our children's health. Lessons from this "case study" have national implications.

Survey tools were used to obtain information about housing and living conditions, health perception, and health status from a representative sample of the population in each city. Results. In Forli, Italy, the first city studied, preliminary findings indicate some important potential links between housing and health. Conclusions. These findings, when combined with those from the remaining European cities, will likely generate concrete recommendations for the allocation of resources to programs that can improve housing and health.

Abstract: In this Utah-based study, we sought to identify the types of municipal employees responsible for physical activity policies, identify municipal ordinances that may influence physical activity, and determine local governments' intentions to implement policies. In 2001, we mailed a survey to all of the state's municipalities with the goal of measuring 6 physical activity domains: sidewalks, bicycle lanes, shared-use paths, work sites, greenways, and recreational facilities. Data from 74 municipalities revealed that planners made up a small proportion of municipal staff. Relative to cities experiencing slow or medium growth, high growth cities reported more ordinances encouraging physical activity. Physical activity policies can be monitored across municipalities. Moreover, evidence-based public health practice provides direction for limited staff and funding resources.

Abstract: Sarasota, Fla, used Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles to guide revitalization efforts in its crime-ridden North Trail area. A team of city planners, police officers, and architects examined land use and crime data and sought input from local businesses, residents, and community leaders. Beginning in 1990, interventions included increased police patrols to reduce prostitution and the creation of a new zoning district to encourage area redevelopment based on CPTED principles. Compared with the rest of Sarasota, from 1990 to 1998 the North Trail Corridor experienced decreases in calls for police service (P<.005), crimes against persons and property (P=not significant), and prostitution (P<.05). These results suggest that community design may be a useful tool for decreasing crime and improving community health.

Abstract: Community gardens enhance nutrition and physical activity and promote the role of public health in improving quality of life. Opportunities to organize around other issues and build social capital also emerge through community gardens. California Healthy Cities and Communities (CHCC) promotes an inclusionary and systems approach to improving community health. CHCC has funded community-based nutrition and physical activity programs in several cities. Successful community gardens were developed by many cities incorporating local leadership and resources, volunteers and community partners, and skills-building opportunities for participants. Through community garden initiatives, cities have enacted policies for interim land and complimentary water use, improved access to produce, elevated public consciousness about public health, created culturally appropriate educational and training materials, and strengthened community building skills.

The Safe Routes to School Program in Marin County, California, is working to promote walking and biking to school. Using a multipronged approach, the program identifies and creates safe routes to schools and invites communitywide involvement. By its second year, the program was serving 4665 students in 15 schools. Participating public schools reported an increase in school trips made by walking (64%), biking (114%), and carpooling (91%) and a decrease in trips by private vehicles carrying only one student (39%).

Abstract: We sought to synthesize evidence of the health effects of construction of new roads by systematically reviewing observational studies of such effects. We included and critically appraised 32 studies. The review suggested that out-of-town bypasses decrease injuries on main roads through or around towns, although more robust evidence is needed on effects on secondary roads. New major urban roads have statistically insignificant effects on injury incidence. New major roads between towns decrease injuries. Out-of-town bypasses reduce disturbance and community severance in towns but increase them elsewhere. Major urban roads increase disturbance and severance. More robust research is needed in this area, particularly regarding effects of new roads on respiratory health, mental health, access to health services, and physical activity.

Abstract: "Sense of place" is a widely discussed concept in fields as diverse as geography, environmental psychology, and art, but it has little traction in the field of public health. The health impact of place includes physical, psychological, social, spiritual, and aesthetic outcomes. In this article, the author introduces sense of place as a public health construct. While many recommendations for "good places" are available, few are based on empirical evidence, and thus they are incompatible with current public health practice. Evidence-based recommendations for healthy place making could have important public health implications. Four aspects of the built environment, at different spatial scales-nature contact, buildings, public spaces, and urban form-are identified as offering promising opportunities for public health research, and potential research agendas for each are discussed.

Abstract: The design of a community's built environment influences the physical and mental health of its residents. Because few studies have investigated this relationship, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hosted a workshop in May 2002 to help develop a scientific research agenda on these issues. Workshop participants' areas of expertise included physical activity, injury prevention, air pollution, water quality, urban planning, transportation, architecture, epidemiology, land use, mental health, social capital, housing, and social marketing. This report describes the 37 questions in the resulting research agenda. The next steps are to define priorities and obtain resources. The proposed research will help identify the best practices for designing new communities and revitalizing old ones in ways that promote physical and mental health.

Abstract: Objectives. The link between income disparities and health has been studied mostly in developed nations. This study assesses the relationship between income disparities and life expectancy in Brazil and measures the impact of illiteracy rates on the association. Methods. The units of analysis (n=27) are all the Brazilian states and the federal capital. Simple and multiple linear regressions were performed to measure the association between income disparity, measured by the Gini coefficient, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and illiteracy rate. Data came from publicly available sources at the Brazilian Ministry of Health and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. Results. Income disparities and illiteracy rates were negatively associated with life expectancy in Brazil. GDP per capita was positively associated with life expectancy. The inclusion of illiteracy rates in the regression model removed the effect of income disparities. Conclusions. Illiteracy rate is strongly associated with life expectancy in Brazil. This finding is in accord with reports from the United States and has implications for health policy and planning for both developed and developing countries.

Abstract: Case study methodology was used to investigate the tobacco industry's strategies to fight local tobacco control efforts in Duluth, Minn. The industry opposed the clean indoor air ordinance indirectly through allies and front groups and directly in a referendum. Health groups failed to win a strong ordinance because they framed it as a youth issue rather than a workplace issue and failed to engage the industry's economic claims. Opponents' overexploitation of weaknesses in the ordinance allowed health advocates to construct a stronger version. Health advocates should assume that the tobacco industry will oppose all local tobacco control measures indirectly, directly, or both.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the association between attributes of primary care providers and care for depression, from a patients' perspective, among a sample of predominantly low-income African American women. Methods. Computer-assisted telephone interviews were conducted among a population-based sample of 1202 women residing in Washington, DC. Results. Respondents whose primary care physicians provided more comprehensive medical services were more likely to be asked about and treated for depressive symptoms than women whose providers were less medically comprehensive. Women who rated their providers as having more respect for them also were more likely to be asked about and treated for depression. Conclusions. More comprehensive primary care delivery and a physician-patient relationship focused on mutual respect are associated with greater rates of physician inquiry about and treatment for depression among vulnerable women.

Abstract: Increasing hepatitis B vaccination rates for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders is a priority. Laws requiring vaccination prior to school enrollment have helped, yet many youths remain unvaccinated. The Hepatitis B Initiative (HBI), launched in 1997 and operated by public health and medical school students, provides free screenings and vaccinations to Boston's Asian American/Pacific Islander community, with a focus on youths. By October 2002, 997 HBI patients from Boston's Chinatown had received free hepatitis B screenings. Of these, 384 patients (39%) were deemed susceptible to the hepatitis B virus and provided with free vaccination.

Abstract: Objective. We sought to understand who constitutes the sizable population of nondaily, or some-day (SD), smokers. Methods. We analyzed descriptive statistics and regression results using the 1998-1999 Current Population Survey Tobacco Use Supplement to determine the prevalence of SD smokers, their sociodemographic characteristics, and the smoking patterns and histories of groups differentiated by the length and stability of their SD smoking. Results. SD smokers make up 19.2% of all current smokers. Among SD smokers, 44.6% have smoked less than daily for at least 1 year, no more than 14.4% are just starting to smoke, and the rest are likely in transition. Overall, SD smokers smoked a mean of 102 cigarettes per month (compared to 566.4 for daily smokers), on an average of 14.5 days out of the past 30. Conclusions. SD smokers make up a substantial segment of the smoking population. They are not just beginning to smoke nor trying to quit. Many have developed a long-standing pattern of nondaily smoking, smoking relatively few cigarettes on the days when they do smoke. They are not substantially younger than daily smokers, as one might expect.

Abstract: Community-based participatory research (CBPR) increasingly is being recognized by health scholars and funders as a potent approach to collaboratively studying and acting to address health disparities. Emphasizing action as a critical part of the research process, CBPR is particularly consistent with the goals of "results-oriented philanthropy" and of government funders who have become discouraged by the often modest to disappointing results of more traditional research and intervention efforts in many low-income communities of color. Supporters of CBPR face challenging issues in the areas of partnership capacity and readiness, time requirements, funding flexibility, and evaluation. The authors suggest strategies for addressing such issues and make a case for increasing support of CBPR as an important tool for action-oriented and community-driven public health research.

Abstract: Objectives. As part of an asthma screening study, we evaluated the relationship of health care insurance coverage to the diagnosis and treatment of elementary school children for asthma and related respiratory problems from 1998 through 2001. Methods. A bilingual questionnaire assessing health care coverage, asthma diagnosis, respiratory symptoms, and use of medications was distributed to parents of 6235 public and private school children in grades 2 through 5 in Passaic, NJ. Results. Responses for 4380 children (70%) revealed disparities in health care coverage and asthma diagnosis among racial and ethnic groups. Mexican and Dominican children had significant increases in health care coverage over the 4 years. Conclusions. The percentage of children with health insurance grew from 67% in 1998 to 81% in 2001, and the increase was related to NJ KidCare. Diagnosis of asthma and treatment were related to health care coverage.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the distribution and individual characteristics of body types on prime-time television. Methods. Five episodes of each of the 10 top-rated prime-time fictional programs on 6 broadcast networks during the 1999-2000 season were quantitatively analyzed. Results. Of 1018 major television characters, 14% of females and 24% of males were overweight or obese, less than half their percentages in the general population. Overweight and obese females were less likely to be considered attractive, to interact with romantic partners, or to display physical affection. Overweight and obese males were less likely to interact with romantic partners and friends or to talk about dating and were more likely to be shown eating. Conclusions. Overweight and obese television characters are associated with specific negative characteristics.

Abstract: Following passage of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, underground coal mine operators were required to take air samples in order to monitor compliance with the exposure limit for respirable dust, a task essential for the prevention of pneumoconiosis among coal workers. Miners objected, claiming that having the mine operators perform this task was like "having the fox guard the chicken coop." This article is a historical narrative of mining industry corruption and of efforts to reform the program of monitoring exposure to coal mine dust. Several important themes common to the practice of occupational health are illustrated; most prominently, that employers should not be expected to regulate themselves.

Abstract: The gap between research and practice is well documented. We address one of the underlying reasons for this gap: the assumption that effectiveness research naturally and logically follows from successful efficacy research. These 2 research traditions have evolved different methods and values; consequently, there are inherent differences between the characteristics of a successful efficacy intervention versus those of an effectiveness one. Moderating factors that limit robustness across settings, populations, and intervention staff need to be addressed in efficacy studies, as well as in effectiveness trials. Greater attention needs to be paid to documenting intervention reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. Recommendations are offered to help close the gap between efficacy and effectiveness research and to guide evaluation and possible adoption of new programs.

Abstract: Objectives. This study sought to determine whether income inequality, household income, and their interaction are associated with health status. Methods. Income inequality and area income measures were linked to data on household income and individual characteristics from the 1994 Canadian National Population Health Survey and to data on self-reported health status from the 1994, 1996, and 1998 survey waves. Results. Income inequality was not associated with health status. Low household income was consistently associated with poor health. The combination of low household income and residence in a metropolitan area with less income inequality was associated with poorer health status than was residence in an area with more income inequality. Conclusions. Household income, but not income inequality, appears to explain some of the differences in health status among Canadians.

Abstract: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1991 chose 10 μg/dL as an initial screening level for lead in children's blood. Current data on health risks and intervention options do not support generally lowering that level, but federal lead poisoning prevention efforts can be improved by revising the follow-up testing schedule for infants aged 1 year or less with blood lead levels of 5 μg/dL or higher; universal education about lead exposure risks; universal administration of improved, locally validated risk-screening questionnaires; enhanced compliance with targeted screening recommendations and federal health program requirements; and development by regulatory agencies of primary prevention criteria that do not use the CDC's intervention level as a target "safe" lead exposure.

Abstract: Objectives. This study evaluated how the elimination of Medicaid reimbursement to dentists for the treatment of adult dental problems affected patients' visits to physicians. Methods. Data tapes describing physicians' claims for adult Medicaid patients were obtained from the Maryland Medicaid Management Information System. The database contains information on all claims made to Maryland Medicaid, including date, provider, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification Manual code, and payments. Results. A total of 5334 individuals made physician's office claims related to dental problems sometime during the 4-year study period. The rate of dental-related claims by physicians decreased by 8% after the policy change. Conclusions. Visits to physicians' offices decreased even though an increase might have been expected because of the elimination of access to dentists in private practice. Patients might have assumed that if visits to dentists would no longer be paid for, neither would visits to physicians' offices.

The authors reviewed all pesticide exposures among children younger than 6 years reported to the South Texas Poison Center during 1997 through 2000. Results. Nonborder counties had twice the reported exposure rate of border counties. Parents of border children were significantly less likely to contact the poison center after an exposure and more likely to have their children evaluated in a health care facility. Conclusions. Increasing residents' awareness of the poison center and identifying potential barriers to its use among residents of Texas-Mexico border communities may prevent unnecessary visits to health care facilities.

Abstract: Objectives. We report on trends in risk factors for lifestyle-related diseases among socioeconomic position (SEP) groups. Methods. We continuously surveyed the adult population of Geneva, Switzerland, for 8 years (1993-2000) with independent, cross-sectional surveys of representative samples (4207 men and 3987 women aged 35-74 years). Age-adjusted linear regression slopes estimated annual risk factor trends. Interaction terms were tested for trend differences between SEP groups. Results. Overall, low-SEP persons had the worst risk factor profiles. Eight-year trends indicate that (1) number of pack-years smoked decreased by half a pack-year among high-SEP female current smokers only; (2) obesity prevalence more than doubled from 5% to 11% among high-SEP men only; (3) systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased similarly in all SEP groups; (4) unsaturated-to-saturated dietary fat ratio declined in the low-SEP group only; and (5) physical inactivity and current/ former cigarette smoking prevalences remained unchanged in all SEP groups. Conclusions. Smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, and physical inactivity are more prevalent among low-SEP persons. Most socioeconomic risk factor differences remained stable in the 1990s. Thus, social inequalities in chronic disease morbidity and mortality will persist in the next decades.

Abstract: Objectives. This study compared trends in the incidence of work-related morbidity and disability across 3 sources of surveillance data in a Canadian province. Methods. Time series estimates of workplace injuries and work-related disability based on 2 panel surveys in the province of Ontario, Canada, for the period 1993-1998 were compared with rates of work-related injury and illness compensation claims during the same period. Results. Lost-time compensation claims declined by 28.8% over this 6-year period. The incidence of self-reported work-related injury declined by 28.2%, and the self-reported incidence of work absence for work-related causes declined by 32.2%. Conclusions. Parallel reductions in work-related morbidity were seen in 3 independent data sources. These results support an interpretation that there has been an important reduction in injury risk in Ontario workplaces over the past decade.

Abstract: Objectives. The purpose of this study was to compare national estimates from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Methods. The authors compared data from the 2 surveys on smoking, height, weight, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, immunization, lack of insurance coverage, cost as a barrier to medical care, and health status. Results. Overall national estimates were similar for 13 of the 14 measures examined. Small differences according to demographic characteristics were found for height and body mass index, with larger differences for health status. Conclusions. Although estimates differed within subgroups, the BRFSS provided national estimates comparable to those of the NHIS. BRFSS national data could provide rapidly available information to guide national policy and program decisions.

Abstract: Objectives. This study described the food environment in 20 Minnesota secondary schools. Methods. Data were collected on school food policies and the availability and nutritional content of foods in school à la carte (ALC) areas and vending machines (VMs). Results. Approximately 36% and 35% of foods in ALC areas and in VMs, respectively, met the lower-fat criterion (≤5.5 fat grams/serving). The chips/crackers category constituted the largest share of ALC foods (11.5%). The median number of VMs per school was 12 (4 soft drink, 2 snack, 5 other). Few school food policies were reported. Conclusions. The availability of healthful foods and beverages in schools as well as school food policies that foster healthful food choices among students needs greater attention.

Abstract: In 1996 we launched a community-provider partnership to raise immunization coverage for children aged younger than 3 years in Northern Manhattan, New York City. The partnership was aimed at fostering provider knowledge and accountability, practice improvements, and community outreach. By 1999 the partnership included 26 practices and 20 community groups. Between 1996 and 1999, immunization coverage rates increased in Northern Manhattan 5 times faster than in New York City and 8 times faster than in the United States (respectively, 3.4% vs 0.4% [t=6.05, p<0.001] and vs 0.6% [t=5.65, p<0.001]). The coverage rate for Northern Manhattan stayed constant through 2000, although it declined during this period for the United States and New York City. We attribute the success at reducing the gap to the effectiveness of our partnership.

Abstract: Objectives. The aims of this study were to describe the characteristics surrounding female-to-female nonpartner violence and to identify independent factors associated with risk of female-to-female intentional injuries. Methods. A case-control investigation was conducted among women who resided in an urban, low-income community and presented for emergency department care for injuries inflicted by female nonpartners. Results. Women were typically victimized by women they knew (88%), in outdoor locations (60%), and in the presence of others (91%). Those found to be at risk for injury typically were young and socially active, used marijuana, and had experienced other kinds of violence. Conclusions. The present results showed that women injured by female nonpartners had limited resources, experienced disorder in their lives, and were the victims of violence within multiple relationships.

Abstract: Objectives. This study estimated the proportion of veterans among homeless women and their risk of homelessness relative to that of nonveterans. Methods. Data came from 2 surveys of homeless women (1 clinical and 1 nonclinical) and 1 survey of domiciled women. Results. The proportion of veterans (4.4%, 3.1%) among homeless women was greater than the proportion among domiciled women (1.3%, 1.2%). When we computed odds ratios for being a veteran among homeless women compared with nonhomeless women, homeless women were significantly more likely than nonhomeless women to be veterans. Conclusions. Women veterans are at greater risk for homelessness than are nonveterans. Further study is needed to determine whether increased risks for veterans are a product of military service or reflect volunteers' self-selection into the armed forces.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the association between young adolescents' dietary behaviors and school vending machines, à la carte programs, and fried potatoes' being served at school lunch. Methods. Using a cross-sectional study design, we measured à la carte availability and the number of school stores, vending machines, and amounts of fried potatoes served to students at school lunch in 16 schools. Grade 7 students (n=598) completed 24-hour dietary recall interviews. Results. À la carte availability was inversely associated with fruit and fruit/vegetable consumption and positively associated with total and saturated fat intake. Snack vending machines were negatively correlated with fruit consumption. Fried potatoes' being served at school lunch was positively associated with vegetable and fruit/vegetable intake. Conclusions. School-based programs that aim to promote healthy eating among youths should target school-level environmental factors.

Volume: 93
Issue: 7
Pages: 1046-1056
Abstract: I offer a historical examination of a group of malaria motion pictures, a subset of a larger genre of public health films. The majority of these more than 100 films were produced or coproduced by American and British agencies or production companies since 1940. The material is divided into 5 chronological periods, which include World War II, the postcolonial or DDT era (1946-1961), and the past 2 decades. The films themselves, I argue, represent a unique record of preventive measures, clinical techniques, and sociocultural biases, all within the context of a history of one of the greatest continuing challenges in public health. The malaria films, as a group, represent a large body of work that has not yet been brought together or analyzed as historical sources.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined age-, sex-, and race-specific gradients in US mortality by area deprivation between 1969 and 1998. Methods. A census-based area deprivation index was linked to county mortality data. Results. Area deprivation gradients in US mortality increased substantially during 1969 through 1998. The gradients were steepest for men and women aged 25 to 44 years and those younger than 25 years, with higher mortality rates observed in more deprived areas. Although area gradients were less pronounced for women in each age group, they rose sharply for women aged 25 to 44 and 45 to 64 years. Conclusions. Areal inequalities in mortality widened because of slower mortality declines in more deprived areas. Future research needs to examine population-level social, behavioral, and medical care factors that may account for the increasing gradient.

Abstract: Objectives. Risks for suicide and nonfatal self-injury hospitalizations associated with previous injury hospitalizations were investigated in a nationwide retrospective cohort study conducted in New Zealand. Methods. Linked data from all New Zealand public hospitals were used to identify individuals with injury hospitalizations. Participants were followed for 12 months. Results. Significantly increased age- and sex-adjusted relative risks for suicide were associated with previous hospitalization for self-injury, injuries of undetermined causes, and assault. Also, elevated risks were associated with these causes of hospitalization in the case of subsequent self-injury hospitalizations. Conclusions. Results indicate that identifiable subgroups of individuals hospitalized for injuries are at marked risk for serious suicidal behavior and suggest the potential of targeted suicide prevention for these individuals.

Abstract: Objectives. This 11-city study sought to identify risk factors for femicide in abusive relationships. Methods. Proxies of 220 intimate partner femicide victims identified from police or medical examiner records were interviewed, along with 343 abused control women. Results. Preincident risk factors associated in multivariate analyses with increased risk of intimate partner femicide included perpetrator's access to a gun and previous threat with a weapon, perpetrator's stepchild in the home, and estrangement, especially from a controlling partner. Never living together and prior domestic violence arrest were associated with lowered risks. Significant incident factors included the victim having left for another partner and the perpetrator's use of a gun. Other significant bivariate-level risks included stalking, forced sex, and abuse during pregnancy. Conclusions. There are identifiable risk factors for intimate partner femicides.

Abstract: Objective. We identified the prevalence and types of violence experienced by pregnant women, the ways victimization changed during pregnancy from the year prior to pregnancy, and factors associated with violence during pregnancy. Methods. We interviewed 914 pregnant women treated in health clinics in Mexico about violence during and prior to pregnancy, violence during childhood and against their own children, and other socioeconomic indicators. Results. Approximately one quarter of the women experienced violence during pregnancy. The severity of emotional violence increased during pregnancy, whereas physical and sexual violence decreased. The strongest predictors of abuse were violence prior to pregnancy, low socioeconomic status, parental violence witnessed by women in childhood, and violence in the abusive partner's childhood. The probability of violence during pregnancy for women experiencing all of these factors was 61%. Conclusions. Violence is common among pregnant women, but pregnancy does not appear to be an initiating factor. Intergenerational violence is highly predictive of violence during pregnancy.

Abstract: Objectives. We investigated physical assault in dating relationships and its co-occurrence with sexual assault from high school through college. Methods. Two classes of university women (n=1569) completed 5 surveys during their 4 years in college. Results. Women who were physically assaulted as adolescents were at greater risk for revictimization during their freshman year (relative risk=2.96); each subsequent year, women who have experienced violence remained at greater risk for revictimization than those who have not. Across all years, women who were physically assaulted in any year were significantly more likely to be sexually assaulted that same year. Adolescent victimization was a better predictor of college victimization than was childhood victimization. Conclusions. There is a need for dating violence prevention/intervention programs in high school and college and for research on factors that reduce revictimization.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the association between 2 dimensions of adults' self-rated health and residential stability in childhood. Methods. Using data from the nationally representative survey Midlife in the United States, I assessed the impact of neighborhood and family stability on positive perceptions of global health and mental health in midlife. Results. Neighborhood stability in childhood is associated with a significant increase in the likelihood that an individual will rate his or her global health highly in midlife. Both neighborhood and family stability are positively associated with good mental health in midlife. Conclusions. These results demonstrate that both childhood family stability and adult social context are associated with health outcomes later in life.

Abstract: We examined co-occurrence of (comorbid) alcohol, drug, and non-substance use psychiatric disorders in a population sample of Mexican-origin adults from rural and urban areas of central California. Co-occurring lifetime rates of alcohol or other drug disorders with non-substance use psychiatric disorders, or both, were 8.3% for men and 5.5% for women and were 12.3% for the US born and 3.5% for immigrants. Alcohol abuse or dependence with co-occurring psychiatric disorders is a primary disorder among Mexican-origin adult males (7.5% lifetime prevalence). US-born men and women are almost equally likely to have co-occuring disorders involving substances. Cobormidity is expected to increase in the Mexican-origin population owing to acculturation effects of both sexes.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the association between parental socioeconomic status (SES) and adolescent smoking. Methods. We conducted telephone interviews with a probability sample of 1308 Massachusetts adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. We used multiple-variable-adjusted logistic regression models. Results. The risk of adolescent smoking increased by 28% with each step down in parental education and increased by 30% for each step down in parental household income. These associations persisted after adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and adolescent disposable income. Parental smoking status was a mediator of these associations. Conclusions. Parental SES is inversely associated with adolescent smoking. Parental smoking is a mediator but does not fully explain the association.

Abstract: Objectives. This study assessed the consistency of estimates of the number of justifiable homicides committed by US police officers and identified sources of underreporting. Methods. The number of justifiable homicides committed by police officers between 1976 and 1998 was estimated from supplementary homicide report (SHR) and National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) mortality data. Results. Nationally, the SHR estimate was 29% larger than the NVSS estimate. However, in most states this pattern was reversed, with more deaths reported in the NVSS. Conclusions. Both systems underreport, but for different reasons. The NVSS misclassifies cases as homicides, rather than justifiable homicides committed by police officers, because certifiers fail to mention police involvement. The SHR misses cases because some jurisdictions fail to file reports or omit justifiable homicides committed by police officers.

Abstract: Objectives. We measured the effect of Hurricane Floyd on Medicaid enrollment and health services use in the most severely affected counties of North Carolina. Methods. We used differences-in-differences models on balanced panels of Medicaid claims and enrollment data. Results. Overall spending per enrollee showed little short-term effect but demonstrated a moderate increase 1 year after the storm. We found very modest short-term increases in Medicaid enrollment, a small long-term decrease in enrollment, and large increases in the long-term use of emergency room and outpatient services. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that hurricane victims experienced substantial changes in patterns of care that endured for much longer than the initial crisis period, These findings can have important implications for the management of disaster relief for this population.

Abstract: Objectives. The authors sought to determine the effects of cold-weather periods on budgets and nutritional outcomes among poor American families. Methods. The Consumer Expenditure Survey was used to track expenditures on food and home fuels, and the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was used to track calorie consumption, dietary quality, vitamin deficiencies, and anemia. Results. Both poor and richer families increased fuel expenditures in response to unusually cold weather. Poor families reduced food expenditures by roughly the same amount as their increase in fuel expenditures, whereas richer families increased food expenditures. Conclusions. Poor parents and their children spend less on and eat less food during cold-weather budgetary shocks. Existing social programs fail to buffer against these shocks.

Abstract: Objective. We compared outcomes, safety, and resource utilization in a collaborative management birth center model of perinatal care versus traditional physician-based ca re. Methods. We studied 2957 low-risk, low-income women: 1808 receiving collaborative care and 1149 receiving traditional care. Results. Major antepartum (adjusted risk difference [RD]=-0.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI]=-2.5, 1.5), intrapartum (adjusted RD=0.8%; 95% CI=-2.4, 4.0), and neonatal (adjusted RD=-1.8%; 95% CI=-3.8, 0.1) complications were similar, as were neonatal intensive care unit admissions (adjusted RD=-1.3%; 95% CI=-3.8, 1.1). Collaborative care had a greater number of normal spontaneous vaginal deliveries (adjusted RD=14.9%; 95% CI=11.5, 18.3) and less use of epidural anesthesia (adjusted RD=-35.7%; 95% CI=-39.5, -31.8). Conclusions. For low-risk women, both scenarios result in safe outcomes for mothers and babies. However, fewer operative deliveries and medical resources were used in collaborative care.

Abstract: Objectives. We describe the prevalence of risk behaviors at baseline among men who have sex with men (MSM) who were enrolled in a randomized behavioral intervention trial conducted in 6 US cities. Methods. Data analyses involved MSM who were negative for HIV antibodies and who reported having engaged in anal sex with 1 or more partners in the previous year. Results. Among 4295 men, 48.0% and 54.9%, respectively, reported unprotected receptive and insertive anal sex in the previous 6 months. Unprotected sex was significantly more likely with 1 primary partner or multiple partners than with 1 nonprimary partner. Drug and alcohol use were significantly associated with unprotected anal sex. Conclusions. Our findings support the continued need for effective intervention strategies for MSM that address relationship status, serostatus of partners, and drug and alcohol use.

Abstract: Objectives. We estimated the number and cost of syphilis-attributable HIV cases among African Americans. Methods. A mathematical model of HIV transmission was used to estimate the number of partnerships consisting of HIV-discordant African Americans in which infectious syphilis was present and the number of new HIV cases attributable to syphilis in these partnerships. Results. In 2000, an estimated 545 new cases of HIV infection among African Americans could be attributed to the facilitative effects of infectious syphilis, at a cost of about $113 million. Conclusions. Syphilis prevention could reduce HIV incidence rates and the disproportionate burden of HIV/AIDS on the African American community, resulting in substantial reductions in future HIV/AIDS medical costs.

Title: Characterizing a "New" Disease: Epizootic and Epidemic Anthrax, 1769-1780

Volume: 93

Pages: 886-893
Abstract: In 1876, Robert Koch established anthrax as the first disease linked to a microbial agent. But Koch's efforts had followed more than 150 years of scientific progress in characterizing anthrax as a specific human and veterinary disease. Focusing on France and the period between 1769 and 1780, this brief review examines noteworthy early events in the characterization of anthrax. It suggests that some "new" diseases like anthrax might be "discovered" not only by luck, brilliance, or new technologies, but by clinical/epidemiological "puzzle-fitting," which can assemble a cohesive picture of a seemingly specific disease entity. If such processes have operated over 2 or more centuries, studying them may yield clues about desirable interactions between epidemiology/public health and experimental science in the characterization of new diseases.

Abstract: Objectives. The authors investigated the effects of cigarette smoking on midlife cognitive performance. Methods. Multiple regression was used to test the association between cigarette smoking and changes in cognitive test scores among male and female members of the British 1946 birth cohort aged between 43 and 53 years. Results. Smoking was associated with faster declines in verbal memory and with slower visual search speeds. These effects were largely accounted for by individuals who smoked more than 20 cigarettes per day and were independent of sex, socioeconomic status, previous (adolescent) cognitive ability, and a range of health indicators. Conclusions. The present results show that heavy smoking is associated with cognitive impairment and decline in midlife. Smokers who survive into later life may be at risk of clinically significant cognitive declines.

Abstract: Objectives. We estimated the proportion of HIV-positive adults who have any sexual contact without disclosure and the proportion of their sexual partnerships that involve unprotected sex without disclosure. Methods. We drew participants from the HIV Cost and Services Utilization Study (n=1421). Interviews assessed disclosure and sexual activities with up to 5 recent partners. Results. Overall, 42% of the gay or bisexual men, 19% of the heterosexual men, and 17% of all the women reported any sex without disclosure, predominately within nonexclusive partnerships (P<.001). Across all groups, 13% of serodiscordant partnerships involved unprotected anal or vaginal sex without disclosure, with no significant difference between groups. Conclusions. Risky sex without disclosure of serostatus is not uncommon among people with HIV.

Abstract: Objectives. The US Department of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with the Congressional Black Caucus, created a new initiative to address the disproportionate ongoing HIV/AIDS crisis in racial/ethnic minority populations. Methods. This initiative included deploying technical assistance teams through the Office of HIV/AIDS Policy. The teams introduced rapid assessment and response methodologies and trained minority communities in their use. Results. The first 3 eligible cities (Detroit, Miami, and Philadelphia) focused assessments in small geographic areas, using multiple methodologies to obtain data. Conclusions. Data from the first 3 eligible cities provided critical information about changing the dynamics of the HIV/AIDS epidemic at the local level, including program and policy changes and infrastructure redeployment targeted at the most serious social and environmental conditions.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the influence of sociodemographic, clinical, and attitudinal variables on the use of alternative therapists by people in care for HIV. Methods. Bivariate and multivariate analyses of baseline data from the nationally representative HIV Cost and Services Utilization Study were conducted. Results. Overall, 15.4% had used an alternative therapist, and among users, 53.9% had fewer than 5 visits in the past 6 months. Use was higher for people who were gay/lesbian, had incomes above $40000, lived in the Northeast and West, were depressed, and wanted more information about and more decisionmaking involvement in their care. Among users, number of visits was associated with age, education, sexual orientation, insurance status, and CD4 count. Conclusions. Among people receiving medical care for HIV, use of complementary care provided by alternative therapists is associated with several sociodemographic, clinical, and attitudinal variables. Evaluation of the coordination of provider-based alternative and standard medical care is needed.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the efficacy of a relationship-based HIV/sexually transmitted disease prevention program for heterosexual couples and whether it is more effective when delivered to the couple or to the woman alone. Methods. Couples (n=217) were recruited and randomized to (1) 6 sessions provided to couples together (n=81), (2) the same intervention provided to the woman alone (n=73), or (3) a 1-session control condition provided to the woman alone (n=63). Results. The intervention was effective in reducing the proportion of unprotected and increasing the proportion of protected sexual acts. No significant differences in effects were observed between couples receiving the intervention together and those in which the woman received it alone. Conclusions. This study demonstrates the efficacy of a relationship-based prevention program for couples at risk for HIV infection.

Abstract: Objectives. This study investigated the socioeconomic profile of foreign-born tuberculosis patients in New Jersey. Methods. Foreign- and US-born tuberculosis patients in 1994-1999 were compared using various measures of socioeconomic status. Results. Out of 4295 tuberculosis patients, 2005 (47%) were foreign-born. Foreign-born patients resided in more affluent, more educated, and less crowded areas than did US-born patients (P < .005). They were also more likely to have been employed during the 2 years before diagnosis (62% vs 41%, P < .001). Private physicians treated the majority of South Asian-born patients. Conclusions. Substantial numbers of employed foreign-born tuberculosis patients now reside in affluent New Jersey locations. Changes in tuberculosis control programs may be required when the socioeconomic status and place of residence of foreign-born populations diverge from traditional assumptions linking poverty with tuberculosis.

Title: The Outing of Philip Morris: Advertising Tobacco to Gay Men

Abstract: Objectives. This case study describes the events surrounding the first time a major tobacco company advertised in gay media. Methods. We analyzed internal tobacco company documents, mainstream newspapers, and the gay press. Results. Philip Morris was unprepared for the attention its entry into the gay market received. The company's reaction to this incident demonstrates that its approach to the gay community both parallels and diverges from industry strategies toward other marginalized communities. Conclusions. The tobacco industry's relationship to the gay community is relatively undeveloped, a fact that may provide tobacco control advocates an opportunity for early intervention. The gay community's particular vulnerabilities to the industry make development of gay tobacco control programs crucial to reducing gay smoking prevalence and industry presence in the community.

Abstract: In 1998, treatment completion was low among chlamydia and gonorrhea cases reported to the San Francisco Department of Public Health and assigned for treatment follow-up. To improve treatment completion among growing numbers of chlamydia and gonorrhea cases, the department implemented field-delivered therapy (FDT), a single-dose, directly observed therapy protocol for uncomplicated chlamydial and gonococcal infections. After the protocol was implemented in March 1999, the proportion of cases completing treatment increased significantly, from 61.8% in 1998 to 81.0% in 2000. The greatest increases in treatment completion were observed for females and individuals younger than 20 years old. FDT is an effective, feasible, and convenient way to reach and treat individuals who are unlikely to return for chlamydia and gonorrhea treatment.

Abstract: Objectives. We describe the intervention tested in EXPLORE, an HIV prevention trial aimed at men who have sex with men (MSM), and test the empirical basis of the individually tailored intervention. Methods. Data on participants' self-efficacy, communication skills, social norms, and enjoyment of unprotected anal intercourse were examined in relation to sexual risk. Combinations of these factors, together with alcohol use and noninjection drug use, were also examined. Results. The individual factors examined were associated with sexual risk behavior. The cohort was shown to be heterogeneous in regard to the presence of combinations of these risk-related factors. Conclusions. Baseline data from the EXPLORE study support the efficacy of the individually tailored intervention used.

Abstract: Objectives. We measured the extent to which a set of psychosocial health problems have an additive effect on increasing HIV risk among men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional household probability telephone sample of MSM in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. Results. Psychosocial health problems are highly intercorrelated among urban MSM. Greater numbers of health problems are significantly and positively associated with high-risk sexual behavior and HIV infection. Conclusions. AIDS prevention among MSM has overwhelmingly focused on sexual risk alone. Other health problems among MSM not only are important in their own right, but also may interact to increase HIV risk. HIV prevention might become more effective by addressing the broader health concerns of MSM while also focusing on sexual risks.

Title: Anthropological Assessment for Culturally Appropriate Interventions Targeting Men Who Have Sex with Men
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Silenzio, V.M.B.
Year: 2003
Volume: 93
Issue: 6
Pages: 867-871
Abstract: Although social and cultural factors play a fundamental role in the health of sexual minority populations and the development of culturally appropriate interventions, public health activities and research have sometimes lacked appropriate sophistication or attention to issues of cultural competency. In areas such as HIV prevention for men who have sex with men (MSM), biomedical interpretations of same-sex phenomena should be applied with caution. Communities and societies may broadly understand same-sex desire, attraction, behavior, and identity through age-structured/initiatory, gender-defined, profession/social role-defined, or egalitarian/gay frameworks. When more detailed, locally specific information is required, such as for youth, ethnic minorities, or urban versus rural populations, the approach to rapid anthropological assessment presented can provide nuanced insights for effective health programs targeting MSM.

Abstract: Objectives. This study assessed relationships between condom availability programs accompanied by community discussion and involvement and adolescent sexual practices. Methods. Sexual practice and condom use differences were assessed in a representative sample of 4166 adolescents enrolled in high schools with and without condom availability programs. Results. Adolescents in schools where condoms were available were more likely to receive condom use instruction and less likely to report lifetime or recent sexual intercourse. Sexually active adolescents in those schools were twice as likely to use condoms, but less likely to use other contraceptive methods, during their most recent sexual encounter. Conclusions. The strategy of making condoms available, an indication of socioenvironmental support for condom use, may improve HIV prevention practices.

Abstract: Addressing differences in social class is critical to an examination of racial disparities in health care. Low socioeconomic status is an important determinant of access to health care. Results from a qualitative, in-depth interview study of 60 African Americans who had one or more chronic illnesses found that low-income respondents expressed much greater dissatisfaction with health care than did middle-income respondents. Low socioeconomic status has potentially deadly consequences for several reasons: its associations with other determinants of health status, its relationship to health insurance or the absence thereof, and the constraints on care at sites serving people who have low incomes.

Abstract: Objectives. We evaluated primary care accessibility and quality for Ontario's aboriginal population. Methods. We compared a defined aboriginal cohort with nonaboriginal populations with analogous geographic isolation and low socioeconomic status. We determined rates of hospitalization for the following indicators of adequacy of primary care: ambulatory care-sensitive (ACS) conditions and utilization of referral care-sensitive (RCS) procedures from administrative databases. Results. ACS hospitalization rates, relative to the general population, were 2.54, 1.50, and 1.14 for the aboriginal population, the geographic control populations, and the socioeconomic control populations, respectively. The relative RCS procedure utilization rates were 0.64, 0.91, and 1.00, respectively. Conclusions. The increased ACS hospitalization rate and reduced RCS procedure utilization rate suggest that northern Ontario's aboriginal residents have insufficient or ineffective primary care.

Abstract: Objective. This study describes key activities integral to the development of 3 community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnerships. Methods. We compared findings from individual case studies conducted at 3 urban research centers (URCs) to identify crosscutting adaptations of a CBPR approach in the first 4 years of the partnerships' development. Results. Activities critical in partnership development include sharing decision-making, defining principles of collaboration, establishing research priorities, and securing funding. Intermediate outcomes were sustained CBPR partnerships, trust within the partnerships, public health research programs, and increased capacity to conduct CBPR. Challenges included the time needed for meaningful collaboration, concerns regarding sustainable funding, and issues related to institutional racism. Conclusions. The URC experiences suggest that CBPR can be successfully implemented in diverse settings.

Pages: 774-778
Abstract: Objectives. This study summarizes current health status information relating to American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) males compared with that of AI/AN females. Methods. I analyzed published data from the Indian Health Service for 1994 through 1996 to determine sex differences in morbidity and mortality rates and use of health care facilities. Results. AI/AN males' death rates exceed those of AI/AN females for every age up to 75 years and for 6 of the 8 leading causes of death. Accidents, suicide, and homicide are epidemic among AI/AN males. Paradoxically, AI/AN males contribute only 37.9% of outpatient visits, versus 62.1% for females, and only 47% of hospitalizations excluding childbirth. Conclusions. AI/AN males suffer inordinately from a combination of increased burden of illness and lack of utilization of health care services. Programs targeted to anomie, loss of traditional male roles, and violence and alcoholism are among the most urgently needed.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the association between leisure time physical activity and cause-specific mortality among male Whitehall Study participants with chronic bronchitis. Methods. Rate ratios were calculated for 4 mortality outcomes, according to level of activity and baseline bronchitis status, in a 25-year follow-up of 6479 men. Results. After multiple adjustment for potential confounding or mediating variables, activity was inversely related to all-cause, cardiovascular, coronary heart disease, and noncardiovascular mortality among men free of chronic bronchitis. Among men with bronchitis, weak, nonsignificant positive associations were observed between activity and these outcomes, with the exception of noncardiovascular mortality. Conclusions. The suggestion of a positive activity-mortality association among individuals with chronic bronchitis-albeit weak and nonsignificant-requires further investigation.

Abstract: Why are men more susceptible to heart disease than women? Traditional risk factors cannot explain the gender gap in coronary heart disease (CHD) or the rapid increase in CHD mortality among middle-aged men in many of the newly independent states of Eastern Europe. However, Eastern European men score higher on stress-related psychosocial factors than men living in the West. Comparisons between the sexes also reveal differences in psychosocial and behavioral coronary risk factors favoring women, indicating that women's coping with stressful events may be more cardioprotective. Men's greater susceptibility to heart disease, particularly observable in many Eastern European countries, poses unique threats to public health and points to solutions in the behavioral and social arena.

Abstract: In this article we describe and analyze the challenges faced by an intervention program that addresses the fatherhood needs of low-income urban African American males. We used life history as the primary research strategy for a qualitative evaluation of a program we refer to as the Healthy Men in Healthy Families Program to better understand the circumstances and trajectory of men's lives, including how involvement in the program might have benefited them in the pursuit of their fatherhood goals. A model of masculine transformation, developed by Whitehead, was used to interpret changes in manhood/fatherhood attitudes and behaviors that might be associated with the intervention. We combined Whitehead's model with a social ecology framework to further interpret challenges at intrapersonal, interpersonal, community, and broader societal levels.

Abstract: US prison inmates are disproportionately indigent young men of color. These individuals are severely affected by HIV/AIDS, largely owing to the high-risk behavior that they engage in prior to incarceration. Researchers and practitioners have issued a call for the importance of offering HIV prevention services in prison settings. However, this call has largely been ignored. In this article, we outline reasons why these recommendations have been largely ignored, discuss innovative HIV prevention programs that are currently being implemented in prison settings, and offer recommendations for securing support for HIV prevention services in correctional settings.

Abstract: Health services at the community level are organized and financed in such a way that men need access but encounter barriers to care such as poor service design, lack of insurance, and the absence of health literacy. Community health delivery systems may not be appropriate, effective, fit, or able to meet the needs they are charged to fill. Community-based health services, including health departments, are underfunded, understaffed, and unable to carry out their mission in a way that protects the health of the community. The current design for funding and delivering health care services excludes poor men, particularly men of color. Improving the health of men requires modifications in the way health care is financed, delivered, and managed.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined African Americans' opinions regarding cigarette excise taxes and other tobacco control issues. Methods. A stratified cluster sample of US congressional districts represented by African Americans was selected. African Americans from 10 districts were interviewed. Results. Forty-seven percent of respondents stated that taxes on tobacco products should be increased, whereas about 30% believed that they should be reduced. Almost 75% disagreed that raising taxes on tobacco products is unfair to African Americans, and 57.9% reported that they would not be opposed to increasing taxes on cigarettes even if low-income smokers would be hit the hardest. Conclusions. The present results indicate substantial support for cigarette excise taxes among African Americans.

Abstract: Objectives. We compared injection-related HIV risk behaviors of Puerto Rican current injection drug users (IDUs) living in New York City and in Puerto Rico who also had injected in the other location with those who had not. Methods. We recruited Puerto Rican IDUs in New York City (n=561) and in Puerto Rico (n=312). Of the former, 39% were "newcomers," having previously injected in Puerto Rico; of the latter, 14% were "returnees," having previously injected in New York. We compared risk behaviors within each sample between those with and without experience injecting in the other location. Results. Newcomers reported higher levels of risk behaviors than other New York IDUs. Newcomer status (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=1.62) and homelessness (adjusted OR=2.52) were significant predictors of "shooting gallery" use; newcomer status also predicted paraphernalia sharing (adjusted OR=1.67). Returnee status was not related to these variables. Conclusions. Intervention services are needed that target mobile populations who are coming from an environment of high-risk behavior to one of low-risk behavior.

Title: Slowing the Epidemic of Tobacco Use among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders

Abstract: Data on tobacco use among the Asian American/Pacific Islander (AAPI) population remain limited, although existing studies indicate that tobacco use prevalence among males from specific AAPI groups is significantly higher than in the general US male population. This high prevalence of tobacco use and the disparities in use result from social norms, targeted marketing by the tobacco industry, lack of culturally and linguistically tailored prevention and control programs, and limited impact of mainstream tobacco control programs for AAPIs. We review the available literature on tobacco use among AAPI men and women, highlight a national agenda that promotes tobacco prevention and control for AAPI communities, and acknowledge recent trends including the increase of tobacco use among AAPI women and girls.

Abstract: Objectives. The purpose of this study was to describe RJ Reynolds (RJR) Tobacco Company's strategy for targeting African Americans, as revealed in tobacco industry documents and magazine advertisements. Methods. The authors searched industry documents to determine RJR's strategies and analyzed magazine advertising during 2 periods: the time of the launch of the company's Uptown cigarette (1989-1990) and a decade later (1999-2000). Results. RJR's efforts to target the African American market segment existed before and after Uptown, and the company's strategy was largely implemented via other RJR brands. Advertisements featured mentholated cigarettes, fantasy/escape, expensive objects, and nightlife. Conclusions. To help all populations become tobacco-free, tobacco control practitioners must understand and counter tobacco industry strategies.

Abstract: We describe an innovative approach for evaluating a men's health center. Using observation and interview, we assessed patient flow, referral patterns, patient satisfaction, and perceptions of the services' usefulness. Student assistants designed evaluation tools, hired and trained research assistants, supervised data collection, interacted with city and center officials, analyzed data, and drafted a report. To ensure patient confidentiality and anonymity, we designed an innovative observation system. The men had unique perceptions of family, requiring culturally sensitive approaches to engage them in the study. Of patients reporting to the center, 20.3% received referral services. Average satisfaction level was 5.2 (scale = 1-10). Perceived benefits to the family for 23% of respondents included cost savings, improved access, and higher service quality.

Volume: 93
Issue: 5
Pages: 753-759
Abstract: Medicare research has shown that there are substantial disparities by race and socioeconomic status in use of services. In this article, I review past research and discuss how findings apply specifically to vulnerable men aged 65 years or older. Six lessons from this review are identified and illustrated here. Disparities in certain measures of health are growing; to reverse this trend, substantial efforts are needed including dissemination of information about disparities as well as testing of hypotheses regarding underlying causes.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined knowledge about prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening among African Americans and Whites. Because PSA screening for prostate cancer is controversial, professional organizations recommend informed consent for screening. Methods. Men (n=304) attending outpatient clinics were surveyed for their knowledge about and experience with screening. Results. Most men did not know the key facts about screening with PSA. African Americans appeared less knowledgeable than Whites, but these differences were mediated by differences in educational level and experience with prostate cancer screening. Conclusions. Public health efforts to improve informed consent for prostate cancer screening should focus on highlighting the key facts and developing different approaches for men at different levels of formal education and prior experience with screening.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined racial/ethnic disparities in mental health service access and use at different poverty levels. Methods. We compared demographic and clinical characteristics and service use patterns of Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians living in low-poverty and high-poverty areas. Logistic regression models were used to assess service use patterns of minority racial/ethnic groups compared with Whites in different poverty areas. Results. Residence in a poverty neighborhood moderates the relationship between race/ethnicity and mental health service access and use. Disparities in using emergency and inpatient services and having coercive referrals were more evident in low-poverty than in high-poverty areas. Conclusions. Neighborhood poverty is a key to understanding racial/ethnic disparities in the use of mental health services.

Abstract: Objectives. This study ascertained the separate and combined effects of having insurance and a usual source of care on receiving preventive services. Methods. Descriptive and multivariate analyses of 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data were conducted. Results. Receipt of preventive services was strongly associated with insurance and a usual source of care. Significant differences were found between insured adults with a usual source of care, who were most likely to have received services, compared with uninsured adults without regular care, who were least likely to have received services. Those with either a usual source of care or insurance had intermediate levels of preventive services. Conclusions. Having a usual source of care and health insurance are both important to achieving national prevention goals.

Pages: 724-731
Abstract: I have summarized in this article data on the magnitude of health challenges faced by men in the United States. Across a broad range of indicators, men report poorer health than women. Although men in all socioeconomic groups are doing poorly in terms of health, some especially high-risk groups include men of low socioeconomic status (SES) of all racial/ethnic backgrounds, low-SES minority men, and middle-class Black men. Multiple factors contribute to the elevated health risks of men. These include economic marginality, adverse working conditions, and gendered coping responses to stress, each of which can lead to high levels of substance use, other health-damaging behaviors, and an aversion to health-protective behaviors. The forces that adversely affect men's health are interrelated, unfold over the life course, and are amenable to change.

Abstract: Objectives. We identify symptom patterns among veterans who believe they suffer from Gulf War-related illnesses and characterize groups of individuals with similar patterns. Methods. A mail survey was completed by 1161 veterans drawn from the Gulf War Health Registry. Results. An exploratory factor analysis revealed 4 symptom factors. A K-means cluster analysis revealed 2 groups: (1) veterans reporting good health and few moderate/ severe symptoms, and (2) veterans reporting fair/poor health and endorsing an average of 37 symptoms, 75% as moderate/severe. Those in Cluster 2 were more likely to report having 1 or more of 24 medical conditions. Conclusions. These findings are consistent with previous investigations of symptom patterns in Gulf War veterans. This multisymptom illness may be more fully characterized by the extent, breadth, and severity of symptoms reported.

Abstract: In June of 2002, the US Supreme Court upheld a regulation that allows employers, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, to make disability-related employment decisions based on risks to an employee's own personal health or safety. Previous judicial decisions had allowed employers to make employment decisions based on the threat that a worker's medical condition posed to others but had not addressed the issue of risk posed to an employee's health by his or her own disability. The authors comment on the potential effects of the court's decision for occupational health practitioners charged with assessing the degree of risk and harm of a particular workplace environment and for public health efforts aimed at curbing workplace injury and sickness.

Abstract: Objectives. This article describes Canadian civil servants' awareness of, attitudes toward, and self-reported use of ideas about the determinants of health. Methods. Federal and provincial civil servants in departments of finance, labor, social services, and health were surveyed. Results. With civil servants in finance departments a notable exception, most Canadian civil servants see the health of populations as a relevant outcome for their sectors. Many (65%) report that ideas about the determinants of health have already influenced policymaking in their sector, but most (83%) say they need more information about the health consequences of the policy alternatives their departments face. Conclusions. Civil servants should consider developing accountability structures for health and researchers should consider producing and transferring more policy-relevant research.

Abstract: Philip Morris Companies, the world's largest and most profitable tobacco seller, has changed its corporate name to The Altria Group. The company has also embarked on a plan to improve its corporate image. Examination of internal company documents reveals that these changes have been planned for over a decade and that the company expects to reap specific and substantial rewards from them. Tobacco control advocates should be alert to the threat Philip Morris's plans pose to industry-focused tobacco control campaigns. Company documents also suggest what the vulnerabilities of those plans are and how advocates might best exploit them.

Abstract: Objectives. This study sought to determine the prevalence of maternal morbidity during labor and delivery in the United States. Methods. Analyses focused on National Hospital Discharge Survey data available for women giving birth between 1993 and 1997. Results. The prevalence of specific types of maternal morbidity was low, but the burden of overall morbidity was high. Forty-three percent of women experienced some type of morbidity during their delivery hospitalization. Thirty-one percent (1.2 million women) had at least 1 obstetric complication or at least 1 preexisting medical condition. Conclusions. Maternal morbidity during delivery is frequent and often preventable. Reducing maternal morbidity is a national health objective, and its monitoring is key to improving maternal health.

Title: Chevron v Echazabal: Protection, opportunity, and paternalism
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Daniels, N.
Year: 2003
Volume: 93
Issue: 4
Pages: 545-548
Abstract: The Supreme Court, in Chevron v Echazabal, ruled that risks to a disabled worker, if established by an individualized medical assessment, can disqualify the worker from protections offered by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). This decision rejected the antipaternalist position of ADA advocates that workers with disabilities should be able to determine, through their own consent, the risks they will take. Such strong antipaternalism may not be compatible with the underlying justification for the protection of workers against health hazards. Stringent regulation of workplace hazards involves restricting the scope of consent to risk. Resolution of this conflict will depend on more careful examination of the degree to which individualized medical assessments avoid stereotyping and bias.

Participants were Cambodian and Lao workers living in Lowell, Mass. A household survey allowed comparisons between characteristics of work-related cases documented in workers' compensation wage replacement records and hospital records and characteristics of self-reported cases. Results. The household survey captured types of cases missing from existing data, particularly illnesses self-reported to be associated with chemical exposures. Injuries and illnesses affecting the study population appeared to be significantly underrepresented in workers' compensation wage replacement data. Conclusions. Community-based methods can supplement available occupational health data sources.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the association between authors' published positions on the safety and efficacy in assisting with weight loss of the Procter & Gamble (P&G) fat substitute olestra and their financial relationships with the food and beverage industry. Methods. Journal articles about olestra, and their authors, were classified as supportive, critical, or neutral with respect to its use. Authors not known to have industry affiliations were surveyed about their financial relationships. Results. Supportive authors were significantly more likely than critical or neutral authors to have financial relationships with P&G (80% vs 11% and 21%, respectively; P<.0001). All authors disclosing an affiliation with P&G were supportive. Conclusions. Because authors' published opinions were associated with their financial relationships, obtaining noncommercial funding may be more essential to maintaining objectivity than disclosing personal financial interests.

We used published and estimated times per service to determine the physician time required to provide all services recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), at the recommended frequency, to a patient panel of 2500 with an age and sex distribution similar to that of the US population. Results. To fully satisfy the USPSTF recommendations, 1773 hours of a physician's annual time, or 7.4 hours per working day, is needed for the provision of preventive services. Conclusions. Time constraints limit the ability of physicians to comply with preventive services recommendations.

Results. Approval of the law rose from 59.8% to 73.2% (odds ratio [OR]= 1.95; 95% confidence interval [Cl]=1.58, 2.40). Self-reported noncompliance decreased from 24.6% 14.0% (OR=0.50; 95% Cl=0.30, 0.85). Likelihood of visiting a bar or of not changing bar patronage after the law was implemented increased from 86% to 91% (OR=1.76; 95% Cl=1.29, 2.40). Conclusions. California bar patrons increasingly support and comply with the smoke-free bar law.

Abstract: Objectives. Data from the 1995-1996 and 1998-1999 Current Population Survey tobacco use supplements were used to examine smoking prevalence statistics by race/ethnicity and immigrant status. Methods. Smoking prevalence statistics were calculated, and these data were decomposed by country of birth for Asian immigrants to illustrate the heterogeneity in smoking rates present within racial/ethnic groups. Results. Except in the case of male Asian/Pacific Islanders, immigrants exhibited significantly lower smoking prevalence rates than nonimmigrants. However, rates varied according to country of birth. Conclusions. This research highlights the need to disaggregate health statistics by race/ethnicity, sex, immigrant status, and, among immigrants, country of birth, Data on immigrants' health behaviors enhance the development of targeted and culturally sensitive public health smoking prevention programs.

Abstract: Objectives. The purpose of the present study was to compare the associations of state-referenced and federal poverty measures with states' infant and child mortality rates. Methods. Compressed mortality and Current Population Survey data were used to examine relationships between mortality and (1) state-referenced poverty (percentage of children below half the state median income) and (2) percentage of children below the federal poverty line. Results. State-referenced poverty was not associated with mortality among infants or children, whereas poverty as defined by national standards was strongly related to mortality. Conclusions. Infant and child mortality is more closely tied to families' capacity for meeting basic needs than to relative position within a state's economic hierarchy.

The evidence from the past 20 years indicates, however, that many community-based programs have had only modest impact, with the notable exception of a number of HIV prevention programs. To better understand the reasons for these outcomes, we conducted a systematic literature review of 32 community-based prevention programs. Reasons for poor performance include methodological challenges to study design and evaluation, concurrent secular trends, smaller-than-expected effect sizes, limitations of the interventions, and limitations of theories used. The effectiveness of HIV programs appears to be related in part to extensive formative research and an emphasis on changing social norms.

Abstract: Objectives. This study explored whether the prevalence of latex-related health conditions has increased among individuals employed in medical occupations relative to those employed in nonmedical occupations since the issuance of universal precautions in 1987. Methods. Data derived from the 1983 to 1994 versions of the National Health Interview Survey were used to obtain odds ratios comparing prevalence rates of latex-related symptoms over time. Results. No statistical evidence was found that the universal precautions resulted in increased prevalence rates of latex-related health conditions among medical workers relative to those employed in nonmedical occupations. Conclusions. Increased use of latex gloves among health care personnel subsequent to the implementation of universal precautions appears to have had no effect on latex allergic reactions experienced by these workers.

Title: Complementary therapy for addiction: "Drumming out Drugs"
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Winkelman, M.
Year: 2003
Volume: 93
Issue: 4
Pages: 647-651
Abstract: Objectives. This article examines drumming activities as complementary addiction treatments and discusses their reported effects. Methods. I observed drumming circles for substance abuse (as a participant), interviewed counselors and Internet mailing list participants, initiated a pilot program, and reviewed literature on the effects of drumming. Results. Research reviews indicate that drumming enhances recovery through inducing relaxation and enhancing theta-wave production and brain-wave synchronization. Drumming produces pleasurable experiences, enhanced awareness of preconscious dynamics, release of emotional trauma, and reintegration of self. Drumming alleviates self-centeredness, isolation, and alienation, creating a sense of connectedness with self and others. Drumming provides a secular approach to accessing a higher power and applying spiritual perspectives. Conclusions. Drumming circles have applications as complementary addiction therapy, particularly for repeated relapse and when other counseling modalities have failed.

Abstract: We report on the creation of an integrative medicine clinic within the setting of a medical research and tertiary care hospital. The clinical audit used a prospective case series of 160 new patients who were followed by telephone interviews over a 6-month period. Patients' demographic characteristics, presenting symptoms and diagnoses, physician treatment recommendations, extent of understanding and adherence to treatment recommendations, changes in symptom intensity, and progress toward achieving health objectives were recorded. Patients at the clinic showed significant reductions in the severity of symptoms and made significant progress toward achieving their health objectives at the 6-month follow-up. Thus far, the clinic's experience suggests that an integrative medicine clinic can face current health care financial challenges and thrive in a conventional medical center.

Abstract: Objectives. We describe tobacco industry strategies to defeat the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Indoor Air Quality rule and the implementation of those strategies. Methods. We analyzed tobacco industry documents, public commentary on, and media coverage of the OSHA rule. Results. The tobacco industry had 5 strategies: (1) maintain scientific debate about the basis of the rule, (2) delay deliberation on the rule, (3) redefine the scope of the rule, (4) recruit and assist labor and business organizations in opposing the rule, and (5) increase media coverage of the tobacco industry position. The tobacco industry successfully implemented all 5 strategies. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that regulatory authorities must take into account the source, motivation, and validity of arguments used in the regulatory process in order to make accurately informed decisions.

Abstract: On June 10, 2002, a unanimous US Supreme Court rejected the claim by Mario Echazabal that he had been denied his rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act when Chevron USA had refused to employ him because he had hepatitis C. Chevron believed that Echazabal's exposure to hepatotoxic chemicals in its refinery would pose a grave risk to his health. This case poses critical questions about the ethics of public health: When, if ever, is paternalism justified? Must choice always trump other values? What ought to be the balance between welfare and liberty? Strikingly, the groups that came to Echazabal's defense adopted an antipaternalistic posture fundamentally at odds with the ethical foundations of occupational health and safety policy.

Abstract: Objectives. We evaluated the relationship between breast and cervical cancer screening and a variety of variables across race/ethnicity groups. Methods. Using logistic regression models, we analyzed data from the 1998 National Health Interview Survey to assess the relative importance of the independent variables in predicting use of cancer screening services. Results. Having a usual source of care was the most important predictor of cancer screening use for all race/ethnicity groups. Health insurance was associated with an increased likelihood of cancer screening. Smoking was associated with a decreased likelihood of cancer screening. Conclusions. Regardless of race/ethnicity, most women follow mammography and cervical cancer screening guidelines. The identification of specific factors associated with adherence to cancer screening guidelines may help inform screening campaigns.

Abstract: Objectives. The goal of this study was to describe acute occupational pesticide-related illnesses among youths and to provide prevention recommendations. Methods. Survey data from 8 states and from poison control center data were analyzed. Illness incidence rates and incidence rate ratios were calculated. Results. A total of 531 youths were identified with acute occupational pesticide-related illnesses. Insecticides were responsible for most of these illnesses (68%), most of which were of minor severity (79%). The average annual incidence rate among youths aged 15 to 17 years was 20.4 per billion hours worked, and the incidence rate ratio among youths vs adults was 1.71 (95% confidence interval = 1.53, 1.91). Conclusions. The present findings suggest the need for greater efforts to prevent acute occupational pesticide-related illnesses among adolescents.

Abstract: Objectives. We investigated socioeconomic disparities in injury hospitalization rates and severity-adjusted mortality for pediatric trauma. Methods. We used 10 years of pediatric trauma data from Sacramento County, Calif, to compare trauma hospitalization rates, trauma mechanism and severity, and standardized hospital mortality across socioeconomic strata (median household income, proportion of households in poverty, insurance). Results. Children from lower-socioeconomic status (SES) communities had higher injury hospitalization and mortality rates, and presented more frequently with more lethal mechanisms of injury (pedestrian, firearm), but did not have higher severity-adjusted mortality. Conclusions. Higher injury mortality rates among children of lower SES in Sacramento County are explained by a higher incidence of trauma and more fatal mechanisms of injury, not by greater injury severity or poorer inpatient care.

Abstract: Antismoking efforts often target teenagers in the hope of producing a new generation of never smokers. Teenagers are more responsive to tobacco taxes than are adults. The author summarizes recent evidence suggesting that delaying smoking initiation among teenagers through higher taxes does not generate proportionate reductions in prevalence rates through adulthood. In consequence, the impact of taxes on smoking among youths overstates the potential long-term public health effects of this tobacco control strategy.

Abstract: An internationally influential model of population health was developed in Canada in the 1990s, shifting the research agenda beyond health care to the social and economic determinants of health. While agreeing that health has important social determinants, the authors believe that this model has serious shortcomings; they critique the model by focusing on its hidden assumptions. Assumptions about how knowledge is produced and an implicit interest group perspective exclude the sociopolitical and class contexts that shape interest group power and citizen health. Overly rationalist assumptions about change understate the role of agency. The authors review the policy and practice implications of the Canadian population health model and point to alternative ways of viewing the determinants of health.

Abstract: Population health is a relatively new term that has not yet been precisely defined, Is it a concept of health or a field of study of health determinants? We propose that the definition be "the health outcomes of a group of individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group," and we argue that the field of population health includes health outcomes, patterns of health determinants, and policies and interventions that link these two. We present a rationale for this definition and note its differentiation from public health, health promotion, and social epidemiology. We invite critiques and discussion that may lead to some consensus on this emerging concept.

Abstract: The Model State Emergency Health Powers Act became a contentious document in more than 30 states in 2001 and 2002. Controversy has focused on recommendations by the authors of the Model Act that seemed to accord higher priority to collective action in emergencies than to protecting privacy and property. This situation has several causes that derive from the characteristics of public health emergencies during the past half century and the relative isolation of public health officials from both their colleagues in government and many members of the public.

Abstract: Objectives. We compared trends in prevalence rates of preventable cardiovascular- and diabetes-related hospitalizations between African Americans and members of other major US racial/ethnic groups. Methods. Standardized rates for 1991 to 1998 were derived from hospital and US census data for California. Results. African Americans had significantly higher hospitalization rates in 1991, and discrepancies in rates continued to widen through 1998. Overall male and female rates were approximately 3 times higher for angina, 7 times higher for hypertension, between 7 and 8 times higher for congestive heart failure, and 10 times higher for diabetes. Conclusions. Widening disparities in cardiovascular- and diabetes-related health conditions were observed in this study, possibly owing to racial inequalities in provision of effective primary care.

Methods. A survey was administered to representative samples of young people from 9 Caribbean countries. Results. Physical/sexual abuse and having a friend or relative who had attempted suicide were associated with an increased prevalence of health-compromising behaviors. Connectedness with parents and school and attendance at religious services were associated with fewer health risk behaviors. Conclusions. When the identified risk and protective factors were compared with those seen among young people in the United States, similarities as well as important differences were found.

Abstract: Objectives. We explored the relationship between boarded-up housing and rates of gonorrhea and premature mortality. Methods. In this ecological study of 107 US cities, we developed several models predicting rates of gonorrhea and premature death before age 65 from all causes and from specific causes. We controlled for race, poverty, education, population change, and health insurance coverage. Results. Boarded-up housing remained a predictor of gonorrhea rates, all-cause premature mortality, and premature mortality due to malignant neoplasms, diabetes, homicide, and suicide after control for sociodemographic factors. Conclusions. Boarded-up housing may be related to mortality risk because of its potential adverse impact on social relationships and opportunities to engage in healthful behaviors. Neighborhood physical conditions deserve further consideration as a potential global factor influencing health and well-being.

Abstract: The authors' 1990 article "Producing Health, Consuming Health Care" presented a conceptual framework for synthesizing a rapidly growing body of findings on the nonmedical determinants of health. The article received a very positive response, and here the authors reflect on what lessons might be learned from that response about the style or content of effective interdisciplinary communication. Much substantive knowledge has been accumulated since 1990, and a number of different frameworks have been developed before and since. The authors situate theirs within this literature and consider how they might have modified it if they "knew then what they know now." They ask what impact this article, and the much broader stream of research on the determinants of health, has had on public policy?

Abstract: Both the medical care and public health systems have invested considerable resources to define, measure, and improve quality and health outcomes. A movement toward accountability has generated performance indicators from the medical arena and "leading health indicators" from the public health arena. The focus on specific conditions by the medical care system has been at odds with public health's emphasis on improving population health and has perpetuated a bifurcated system. Aligning the goals of medical care with those of public health will require reformulation of performance measurement and accountability into a common language that is valued by both systems. Such a creation would amount to a whole that is stronger than the sum of the component parts.

Logistic regression analyses were used to predict noncollection of checks; demographic characteristics, program participation, and problems with the WIC program were independent variables. Results. Strong predictors of noncollection of checks were job conflicts, transportation or illness problems, and WIC receipt by the woman herself (rather than by her children). Conclusions. Employment conflicts were related to failure to pick up WIC checks; immigration concerns were not. As a means of enhancing WIC participation, flexibility is recommended in terms of center hours, locations, and staffing and program check distribution policies.

Abstract: Objectives. This study sought to identify the risk factors associated with an outbreak of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) among Filipino laborers in Taiwan. Methods. Forty-six SJS/TEN patients were matched to 92 controls according to month of arrival in Taiwan, sex, and age. Results. The odds ratio for development of SJS/TEN was 9.5 (95% confidence interval [Cl]=3.9, 23.9) among workers who had used both metronidazole and mebendazole sometime in the preceding 6 weeks. In addition, a gradient increase in the occurrence of SJS/TEN was found with an increasing level of exposure to metronidazole. Conclusions. This outbreak highlights the risk of SJS/TEN resulting from the use of both metronidazole and mebendazole and the need for control measures.

Abstract: It is commonly accepted that adolescence is the period for initiation into smoking and other tobacco use behaviors. However, evidence is increasing that the set of presumptions about adolescent onset of tobacco use may not be true for all cultural or sub-population groups. Secondary analysis of data from the 2000 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) was used to examine ethnic differences in smoking patterns among African American and White women. Results showed a striking racial/ ethnic difference in age of onset; African American women initiate smoking later than White women at each age group. Prevention interventions need to continue beyond adolescence well into the adult years, especially for African American women. Late onset for these women represents an often missed window of opportunity for prevention.

Abstract: By raising the price of cigarettes through tobacco taxes, policymakers might only be delaying some smokers' initiation of smoking rather than permanently preventing them from smoking. This is one of several reasons for adopting a balanced tobacco control policy that relies only in part on cigarette taxation.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to quantify the effect of good smoking hygiene on infant risk of respiratory tract infection in the first 12 months of life. Methods. A cohort of 4486 infants in Tasmania, Australia, was followed from birth to 12 months of age for hospitalization with respiratory infection. Case ascertainment was 98.2%. Results. Relative to the infants of mothers who smoked postpartum but never in the same room with their infants, risk of hospitalization was 56% (95% confidence interval [Cl]=13%, 119%) higher if the mother smoked in the same room with the infant, 73% (95% Cl=18%, 157%) higher if the mother smoked when holding the infant, and 95% (95% Cl=28%, 298%) higher if the mother smoked while feeding the infant. Conclusions. Parents who smoke should not smoke with their infants present in the same room.

Abstract: Objectives. We created indicators of local public health agency capacity to engage in community-based participatory public health. Methods. We sent a survey of 27 items reflecting aspects of community-based participatory public health to 429 employees in 4 local health departments. Two thirds (n = 282) responded. We performed a factor analysis to identify components of community-based participatory practice. Results. We identified 4 factors: (1) the agency's and (2) the individual employee's skills in working with community groups and minority populations, (3) the extent and frequency of agency networking, and (4) community participation in health department planning. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that it is possible to measure the competencies needed by health department staff to engage in community-based participatory public health.

Volume: 93

Abstract: The history of health determinants in Canada influenced both the direction of data gathering about population health and government policies designed to improve health. Two competing movements marked these changes. The idea of health promotion grew out of the 1974 Lalonde report, which recognized that determinants of health went beyond traditional public health and medical care, and argued for the importance of socioeconomic factors. Research on health inequalities was led by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research in the 1980s, which produced evidence of health inequalities along socioeconomic lines and argued for policy efforts in early child development. Both movements have shaped current information gathering and the policies that have come to be labeled "population health.

Volume: 93
Issue: 3
Pages: 421-431
Abstract: The origin of the population health approach is an historic debate over the relationship between economic growth and human health. In Britain and France, the Industrial Revolution disrupted population health and stimulated pioneering epidemiological studies, informing the early preventive public health movement. A century-long process of political adjustment between the forces of liberal democracy and propertied interests ensued. The 20th-century welfare states resulted as complex political mechanisms for converting economic growth into enhanced population health. However, the rise of a "neoliberal" agenda, denigrating the role of government, has once again brought to the fore the importance of prevention and a population health approach to map and publicize the health impacts of this new phase of "global" economic growth.

Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Kickbusch, I.

Volume: 93
Issue: 3
Pages: 383-388
Abstract: The author traces the development of the concept of health promotion from 1980s policies of the World Health Organization, Two approaches that signify the modernization of public health are outlined in detail: the European Health for All targets and the settings approach. Both aim to reorient health policy priorities from a risk factor approach to strategies that address the determinants of health and empower people to participate in improving the health of their communities. These approaches combine classic public health dictums with "new" strategies, some setting explicit goals to integrate public health with general welfare policy. Health for All, health promotion, and population health have contributed to this reorientation in thinking and strategy, but the focus of health policy remains expenditure rather than investment.

Abstract: The authors evaluated the effects of cultural norms and social contexts on coping processes involved in dealing with perceived racial discrimination. Cross-sectional data derived from personal interviews with Korean immigrants residing in Toronto were analyzed. Among the respondents, active, problem-focused coping styles were more effective in reducing the impacts on depression of perceived discrimination, while frequent use of passive, emotion-focused coping had debilitating mental health effects. The present findings lend greater support to a social contextual explanation than to a cultural maintenance explanation of coping processes. They also suggest that, when empowered with sufficient social resources, racial minority individuals of diverse cultural heritages are more likely to confront than to accept racial bias.

Abstract: Objectives. This article synthesizes information about cancer in 9 populations of minority women: Mexican American, Puerto Rican, Cuban American, African American, Asian American, Native Hawaiian, American Samoan, American Indian, and Alaska Native. Methods. Cancer registry data, social indicators, government sources, and published articles were searched for information on the background and cancer experience of these 9 racial/ethnic groups. Results. Approximately 35 million women in these racial/ethnic groups live in the United States, and their numbers are increasing rapidly. Since 1992, incidence rates for major cancer sites have slowed or decreased among these groups, but declines in mortality have not occurred or have been smaller than for Whites. Gaps in early detection have narrowed, but minority women still lag behind Whites. Smoking and obesity remain common in these populations. Conclusions. More culturally appropriate interventions and research are needed, and these efforts must involve the community and raise the quality of health services.

Abstract: The authors invoke a population health perspective to assess the distribution of environmental hazards according to race/ethnicity, social class, age, gender, and sexuality and the implications of these hazards for health. The unequal burden of environmental hazards borne by African American, Native American, Latino, and Asian American/Pacific Islander communities and their relationship to well-documented racial/ethnic disparities in health have not been critically examined across all population groups, regions of the United States, and ages. The determinants of existing environmental inequities also require critical research attention. To ensure inclusiveness and fill important gaps, scientific evidence is needed on the health effects of the built environment as well as the natural environment, cities and suburbs as well as rural areas, and indoor as well as outdoor pollutants.

Abstract: Research on racism as a harmful determinant of population health is in its infancy. Explicitly naming a long-standing problem long recognized by those affected, this work has the potential to galvanize inquiry and action, much as the 1962 publication of the Kempe et al. scientific article on the "battered child syndrome" dramatically increased attention to - and prompted new research on - the myriad consequences of child abuse, a known yet neglected social phenomenon. To further work on connections between racism and health, the author addresses 3 interrelated issues: (1) links between racism, biology, and health; (2) methodological controversies over how to study the impact of racism on health; and (3) debates over whether racism or class underlies racial/ethnic disparities in health.

Patterns of employment in the U.S. workforce according to education, gender, and race/ethnicity are discussed, and how these patterns might cause disproportionate exposure leading to disproportionate disease and injury. Methodological issues are explored that have hampered research about occupational health disparities, and future research needs are identified.

Four recommendations are made on the basis of a review of the sociological and social epidemiology literature on residential segregation: (1) develop multilevel research designs to examine the effects of individual, neighborhood, and metropolitan-area factors on health outcomes; (2) continue examining the health effects of residential segregation among African Americans but also initiate studies examining segregation among Hispanics and Asians; (3) consider racial/ethnic segregation along with income segregation and other metropolitan area factors such as poverty concentration and metropolitan governance fragmentation; and (4) develop better conceptual frameworks of the pathways that may link various segregation dimensions to specific health outcomes.

Abstract: A growing body of research explores the impact of encounters with racism or discrimination on physiological activity. Investigators have collected these data in laboratories and in controlled clinical settings. Several but not all of the studies suggest that higher blood pressure levels are associated with the tendency not to recall or report occurrences identified as racist and discriminatory. Investigators have reported that physiological arousal is associated with laboratory analogues of ethnic discrimination and mistreatment. Evidence from survey and laboratory studies suggests that personality variables and cultural orientation moderate the impact of racial discrimination. The neural pathways that mediate these physiological reactions are not known. The evidence supports the notion that direct encounters with discriminatory events contribute to negative health outcomes.

Abstract: There is extensive evidence of racial/ethnic disparities in receipt of health care. The potential contribution of provider behavior to such disparities has remained largely unexplored. Do health and human service providers behave in ways that contribute to systematic inequities in care and outcomes? If so, why does this occur? The authors build on existing evidence to provide an integrated, coherent, and sound approach to research on providers' contributions to racial/ ethnic disparities. They review the evidence regarding provider contributions to disparities in outcomes and describe a causal model representing an integrated set of hypothesized mechanisms through which health care providers' behaviors may contribute to these disparities.

Abstract: The author examines available evidence on the effects of exposure to joblessness on emotional well-being according to race and sex. The impact of racism on general health outcomes also is considered, particularly racism in the specific form of wage discrimination. Perceptions of racism and measured exposures to racism may be distinct triggers for adverse health outcomes. Whether the effects of racism are best evaluated on the basis of self-classification or social classification of racial identity is unclear. Some research sorts between the effects of race and socioeconomic status on health. The development of a new longitudinal database will facilitate more accurate identification of connections between racism and negative health effects.

Abstract: The resistance of disadvantaged groups to anti-smoking advice is remarkable. In relation to the study of differing cultures, there is a long-standing academic tradition assuming that behavior that may otherwise be difficult to understand is indeed rational within particular cultural contexts. Persistent smoking among the most deprived members of society may represent a rational response to their life chances informed by a lay epidemiology. Health promotion initiatives designed to reduce smoking among members of these groups may continue to fail unless the general health and life chances of such individuals are first improved.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined whether differences in access to health care, health coverage, and socioeconomic status (SES) explained racial differences in influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates in individuals with diabetes. Methods. We analyzed data on 1906 individuals from the 1998 National Health Interview Survey. We used multiple logistic regression to adjust for race/ethnicity, age, access to care, health insurance, and SES, and used SUDAAN for statistical analyses to yield national estimates. Results. Whites had higher vaccination rates than did African Americans or Hispanics. After adjustment for covariates, race/ethnicity predicted receipt of both vaccines independent of age, access to care, health care coverage, and SES. Conclusions. Racial disparity in vaccination rates for adults with diabetes is independent of access to care, health care coverage, and SES.

Volume: 93
Issue: 2

Abstract: Differences in health across ethnic groups have been documented in the United States and the United Kingdom. The extent to which socioeconomic inequalities underlie such differences remains contested, with many instead focusing on cultural or genetic explanations. In both the United States and the United Kingdom, data limitations have greatly hampered investigations of ethnic inequalities in health. Perhaps foremost of these is the inadequate measurement of ethnicity, but also important is the lack of good data on socioeconomic position, particularly data that address life-course issues. Other elements of social disadvantage, particularly experiences of racism, are also neglected. The author reviews existing evidence and presents new evidence to suggest that social and economic inequalities, underpinned by racism, are fundamental causes of ethnic inequalities in health.

Abstract: A recent surgeon general's report and various studies document racial and ethnic disparities in mental health care, including gaps in access, questionable diagnostic practices, and limited provision of optimum treatments. Bias is a little studied but viable explanation for these disparities. It is important to isolate bias from other barriers to high-quality mental health care and to understand bias at several levels (practitioner, practice network or program, and community). More research is needed that directly evaluates the contribution of particular forms of bias to disparities in the area of mental health care.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined whether use of equipment (technological assistance) to cope with disability was associated with use of fewer hours of help from another person (personal assistance). Methods. In a cross-sectional study of 2368 community dwellers older than 65 years with 1 or more limitations in basic activities of daily living (ADLs) from the 1994 National Long Term Care Survey, the relation between technological assistance and personal assistance was examined. Results. Among people with ADL limitations, multivariate models showed a strong and consistent relation between technological assistance and personal assistance, whereby use of equipment was associated with fewer hours of help. Conclusions. Among people with disability, use of assistive technology was associated with use of fewer hours of personal assistance.

Title: Prejudice as stress: Conceptual and measurement problems
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Meyer, I.H.

Volume: 93
Issue: 2
Pages: 262-265
Abstract: In the field of social sciences, there has been a renewed interest in studying prejudice and discrimination as stressors and assessing their impact on various health outcomes. This raises a need for theoretically based and psychometrically sound measures of prejudice. As researchers approach this task, there are several conceptual issues that need to be addressed. The author describes 3 such issues related to (1) individual versus structural measures of the impact of prejudice, (2) objective versus subjective assessments of stress, and (3) measures of major events versus everyday discrimination. How researchers approach the problem of measurement depends on the specific study aims, but they must consider these conceptual issues and understand the advantages and limitations of various approaches to the study of prejudice as stress.

Abstract: The authors review the available empirical evidence from population-based studies of the association between perceptions of racial/ethnic discrimination and health. This research indicates that discrimination is associated with multiple indicators of poorer physical and, especially, mental health status. However, the extant research does not adequately address whether and how exposure to discrimination leads to increased risk of disease. Gaps in the literature include limitations linked to measurement of discrimination, research designs, and inattention to the way in which the association between discrimination and health unfolds over the life course. Research on stress points to important directions for the future assessment of discrimination and the testing of the underlying processes and mechanisms by which discrimination can lead to changes in health.

Abstract: Objectives. This study investigated the effect of healthy lifestyle behaviors on self-rated health and self-care ability over a 10-year follow-up period in older persons in the SENECA study. Methods. Health status and lifestyle behaviors were examined in 1988/1989, 1993, and 1999 in 216 men and 264 women, born between 1913 and 1918, from 7 European countries. Results. Self-rated health and self-care ability declined in men and women with healthy and unhealthy lifestyle habits over the 10-year follow-up period. Inactive and smoking persons had an increased risk for a decline in health status as compared with active and nonsmoking people. No effect of a healthy, Mediterranean-like diet on the deterioration in health status was observed. Conclusions. Being physically active and nonsmoking delayed deterioration in health status in older participants aged 70 to 75 years in the SENECA study.

Abstract: Objectives. This study assessed predictors of the onset of natural menopause in African American women. Methods. We used mailed questionnaires to collect data at baseline in 1995 and during follow-up from Black Women's Health Study participants. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess potential predictors - including experiences of racism - of the onset of natural menopause among 17 070 women aged 35 to 55 years and premenopausal in 1995. Results. The hazard ratio (HR) was 1.43 for current smokers (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.24, 1.66) and 1.21 (95% CI=1.06, 1.38) for ex-smokers and significantly less for obese women and oral contraceptive users. Hazard ratios for most questions about racism were elevated by 10% to 30% but were not statistically significant. Conclusions. Earlier onset of natural menopause among African American women is strongly associated with smoking and inversely associated with body mass index and oral contraceptive use.

Methods. We interviewed 30 African American and 26 American Indian women with constant comparison techniques. We analyzed the data with a coding system developed from the data. Results. The women led active, busy lives. Most perceived physical activity as being good for them, identified constraints to time and space for physical activity, and wanted social support for physical activity. Sociocultural issues also were related to physical activity. Conclusions. Both personal and cultural values influenced the women's physical activity behaviors.

Abstract: Violence is a public health problem that can be understood and changed. Research over the past 2 decades has demonstrated that violence can be prevented and that, in some cases, prevention programs are more cost-effective than other policy options such as incarceration. The United States has much to contribute to - and stands to gain much from - global efforts to prevent violence. A new World Health Organization initiative presents an opportunity for the United States to work with other nations to find cost-effective ways of preventing violence and reducing its enormous costs.

Abstract: Objectives. We investigated hysterectomy prevalence among Hispanic women. Methods. We obtained data from 4684 Hispanic women and 20 604 non-Hispanic White women from the 1998-1999 National Health Interview Survey. We calculated nationally representative odds ratios of previous hysterectomy, controlling for confounders. Results. Compared with non-Hispanic White women, the odds ratio for hysterectomy was 0.36 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.30, 0.44) for Hispanic women with no high school diploma, 0.57 (95% CI=0.44, 0.74) for high school graduates, and 0.67 (95% CI=0.42, 0.87) for college attenders. Country of origin had little influence on hysterectomy prevalence. Hysterectomy was positively associated with acculturation. Conclusions. Hispanic women undergo fewer hysterectomies than do non-Hispanic White women. The reasons for this, as well as information on ethnicity-specific appropriateness of hysterectomy, should be explored.

Abstract: Although Canadian health care seems to be perennially in crisis, access, quality, and satisfaction in Canada are relatively high, and spending is relatively well controlled. The Canadian model is built on a recognition of the limits of markets in distributing medically necessary care. Current issues in financing and delivering health care in Canada deserve attention. Key dilemmas include intergovernmental disputes between the federal and provincial levels of government and determining how to organize care, what to pay for (comprehensiveness), and what incentive structures to put in place for payment. Lessons for the United States include the importance of universal coverage, the advantages of a single payer, and the fact that systems can be organized on a subnational basis.

Author-Name: Hoffman, B.

Volume: 93
Issue: 1

Abstract: Because of the importance of grassroots social movements, or "change from below," in the history of US reform, the relationship between social movements and demands for universal health care is a critical one. National health reform campaigns in the 20th century were initiated and run by elites more concerned with defending against attacks from interest groups than with popular mobilization, and grassroots reformers in the labor, civil rights, feminist, and AIDS activist movements have concentrated more on immediate and incremental changes than on transforming the health care system itself. However, grassroots health care demands have also contained the seeds of a wider critique of the American health care system, leading some movements to adopt calls for universal coverage.

Pages: 112-115
Abstract: Before 1971, all proposals for universal health insurance were based on private sector financing and administration. After 1971, universal health insurance plans relying on the private sector complicated efforts of the universal health insurance movement. To forge as broad a movement for universal health insurance as possible, it may be worthwhile for universal health insurance advocates of different persuasions to seek common ground on the basis of a set of goals for a new health care system. The goals can serve as a measuring stick to determine which health insurance plans are worthy of support.

Abstract: Objectives. We used data from birth certificates, Medicaid, and the Special Supple-mental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to examine the relationship of child participation in WIC to Medicaid costs and use of health care services in North Carolina. Methods. We linked Medicaid enrollment, Medicaid paid claims, and WIC participation files to birth certificates for children born in North Carolina in 1992. We used multiple regression analysis to estimate the effects of WIC participation on the use of health care services and Medicaid costs. Results. Medicaid-enrolled children participating in the WIC program showed greater use of all types of health care services compared with Medicaid-enrolled children who were not WIC participants. Conclusions. The health care needs of low-income children who participate in WIC may be better met than those of low-income children not participating in WIC.

Abstract: Drawing lessons from international experience for health care reform in the United States requires striking a difficult balance between historical determinism and free will, between cynical pessimism and naïve optimism. The key to this puzzle may lie in a paradox: The United States is the most successful exporter of public health policy ideas and instruments yet has failed to build an effective health care system. General ideas (like notions about the role of competition) and microinstruments (like diagnosis-related groups) travel better than do health care systems. Ideas can be adapted to local circumstances, and instruments may easily fit into preexisting systems. Importing systems from countries with different histories and institutions would require a tectonic shift in the American political landscape.

Author-Name: Akhter, M.N.
Year: 2003
Volume: 93
Issue: 1
Pages: 99-101
Abstract: The American Public Health Association (APHA) has long advocated the development of a system of universal health care for all US residents. APHA has adopted several policies on this topic that stress the financing of the system of universal health care under a single-payer mechanism. However, this approach has never been adopted by US policymakers. The need for universal health coverage in the United States is growing more acute, and failure to provide such coverage threatens the health status of the public. I propose an alternative approach to the single-payer system that is based on incremental extension of existing coverage mechanisms, accompanied by fundamental reform of the health care delivery system. This approach is in keeping with the traditional methods of policy development in the United States, and I urge APHA to assume leadership in advocating it.

Abstract: Employers were a major cause of the failure of President Clinton's Health Security bill. This did not have to be so. The substantive and political factors that caused employers to turn against the Clinton Plan could prove instructive in the next reform effort. The unwillingness of employers who do provide benefits to engage seriously in the struggle over health care reform contributes to maintaining the status quo that penalizes them while rewarding employers who fail to provide coverage. The lessons that can be learned from the Clinton Plan debate, if heeded by both employers and health reform advocates, raise hope that key elements of the business community can play a positive role in the next comprehensive health reform effort.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined whether patients' perceptions of their relationships with primary care practitioners (PCPs) vary by vulnerability status and assessed the extent to which gatekeeping arrangements and primary care performance moderate potential disparities. Methods: We used the nationally representative 1996-1997 Community Tracking Study Household Survey as our data source. Results. Whites reported better patient-practitioner relationships than minorities. Requirements that patients select a PCP and obtain referral authorization neither reduced nor exacerbated racial disparities in the patient-practitioner relationship. On the other hand, access to and continuity with a PCP substantively reduced disparities, especially for the most vulnerable group. Conclusions. Enhancing primary care performance may reduce some of the barriers to care experienced by vulnerable populations, thereby improving patients' relationships with their PCPs.

Abstract: Single-payer national health insurance could cover the uninsured and upgrade coverage for most Americans without increasing costs; savings on insurance overhead and other bureaucracy would fully offset the costs of improved care. In contrast, proposed incremental reforms are projected to cover a fraction of the uninsured, at great cost. Moreover, even these projections are suspect; reforms of the past quarter century have not stemmed the erosion of coverage. Despite incrementalists' claims of pragmatism, they have proven unable to shepherd meaningful reform through the political system. While national health insurance is often dismissed as ultra left by the policy community, it is dead center in public opinion. Polls have consistently shown that at least 40%, and perhaps 60%, of Americans favor such reform.

Abstract: US analysts and decisionmakers interested in comparative health policy typically turn to European perspectives, but Brazil-notwithstanding its far smaller gross domestic product and lower per capita health expenditures and technological investments-offers an example with surprising relevance to the US health policy context. Not only is Brazil comparable to the United States in size, racial/ethnic and geographic diversity, federal system of government, and problems of social inequality. Within the health system the incremental nature of reforms, the large role of the private sector, the multitiered patch-work of coverage, and the historically large population excluded from health insurance coverage resonate with health policy challenges and developments in the United States.

Abstract: Many uninsured Americans are already eligible for free or low-cost public coverage through Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) but do not "take up" that coverage. However, several other public programs, such as food stamps and unemployment insurance, also have less-than-complete take-up rates, and take-up rates vary considerably among programs. This article examines the take-up literature across a variety of programs to learn what effects nonfinancial features, such as administrative complexity, have on take-up. We find that making benefit receipt automatic is the most effective means of ensuring high take-up, while there is little evidence that stigma is important.

Abstract: Britain's National Health Service (NHS) was established in the wake of World War II amid a broad consensus that health care should be made available to all. Yet the British only barely succeeded in overcoming professional opposition to form the NHS out of the prewar mixture of limited national insurance, various voluntary insurance schemes, charity care, and public health services. Success stemmed from extraordinary leadership, a parliamentary system of government that gives the winning party great control, and a willingness to make major concessions to key stakeholders. As one of the basic models emulated worldwide, the NHS - in both its original form and its current restructuring offers a number of relevant lessons for health reform in the United States.

Title: A joint urban planning and public health framework: Contributions to health impact assessment

Abstract: A joint urban planning and public health perspective is articulated here for use, in health impact assessment. Absent a blueprint for a coherent and supportive structure on which to test our thinking, we are bound to fall flat. Such a perspective is made necessary by the sheer number of people living in cities throughout the world, the need for explicit attention to land use and transportation systems as determinants of population health, and the dearth of useful indicators of the built environment for monitoring progress. If explicit attention is not paid to the overarching goals of equality and democracy, they have little if any chance of being realized in projects, programs, and policies that shape the built environment and therefore the public's health.

Title: The health care system under French national health insurance: Lessons for health reform in the United States
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Rodwin, V.G.
Year: 2003
Volume: 93
Issue: 1
Pages: 31-37
Abstract: The French health system combines universal coverage with a public-private mix of hospital and ambulatory care and a higher volume of service provision than in the United States. Although the system is far from perfect, its indicators of health status and consumer satisfaction are high; its expenditures, as a share of gross domestic product, are far lower than in the United States; and patients have an extraordinary degree of choice among providers. Lessons for the United States include the importance of government's role in providing a statutory framework for universal health insurance; recognition that piecemeal reform can broaden a partial program (like Medicare) to cover, eventually, the entire population; and understanding that universal coverage can be achieved without excluding private insurers from the supplementary insurance market.

Title: Affordable health insurance for all is possible by means of a pragmatic approach
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Tooker, J.
Year: 2003
Volume: 93
Issue: 1
Pages: 106-109
Abstract: America can attain affordable health insurance coverage for all by using a pragmatic approach. Such an effort must accommodate the realities of the American health care system and resist the temptation to propose radical restructuring. The congressional strategy for universal health care described here was developed by the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine. It builds on the strengths of the current pluralistic system by combining the benefits of public health plans such as Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program with a more competitive and affordable private insurance market. The health care system has reached a crisis point. Allowing the status quo to continue courts certain disaster.

Abstract: German Statutory Health Insurance (national health insurance) has remained relatively intact over the past century, even in the face of governmental change and recent reforms. The overall story of German national health insurance is one of political compromise and successful implementation of communitarian values. Several key lessons from the German experience can be applied to the American health care system.

Abstract: Members of the Rekindling Reform Steering Committee collaborated over a period of several months in early 2002 to develop a set of principles and goals to help guide and define the group's efforts for comprehensive health care reform in the United States. The next step is to circulate this document to the sponsoring organizations for their approval. This document is, then, a work in progress, subject to revision as the process of discussion and review continues. These principles provide a sense of the lessons members of the Rekindling Reform Steering Committee have learned from their study of other countries' universal health care systems, and how those lessons have informed their thinking about the nature of the health care reform needed in United States.

Title: Is social capital the key to inequalities in health?
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Pearce, N.

Volume: 93
Issue: 1
Pages: 122-129
Abstract: There has been vigorous debate between the "social capital" and "neomaterialist" interpretations of the epidemiological evidence regarding socioeconomic determinants of health. We argue that levels of income inequality, social capital, and health in a community may all be consequences of more macrolevel social and economic processes that influence health across the life course. We discuss the many reasons for the prominence of social capital theory, and the potential drawbacks to making social capital a major focus of social policy. Intervening in communities to increase their levels of social capital may be ineffective, create resentment, and overload community resources, and to take such an approach may be to "blame the victim" at the community level while ignoring the health effects of macrolevel social and economic policies.

Pages: 109-111
Abstract: Recent evaluations of the California Health Service Plan (CHSP) confirmed that financing health care through a single government payer can provide universal coverage-while saving significantly on health care spending - to a degree unparalleled by alternative approaches. Public ownership of the delivery system can further provide authority and accountability for critical reforms that improve the population's health and quality of care, including coordination of the delivery system. The federal government's State Planning Grant Program provides states with funding to develop plans to cover their uninsured populations. California created a Health Care Options Project that requested proposals that could expand coverage and contracted with a financial modeler and a qualitative analyst to evaluate the resulting plans. The CHSP was one of 9 plans evaluated through this process.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the association between intermittent lack of health insurance coverage and use of preventive health services. Methods. Analyses focused on longitudinal data on insurance status and preventive service use among a national sample of US adults who participated in the Health and Retirement Study. Results. Findings showed that, among individuals who obtain insurance coverage after histories of intermittent coverage, relatively long periods may be necessary to reestablish clinically appropriate care patterns. Increasing periods of noncoverage led to successively lower rates of use of most preventive services. Conclusions. Intermittent lack of insurance coverage - even across a relatively long period - results in less use of preventive services. Studies that examine only current insurance status may underestimate the population at risk from being uninsured.

Abstract: The health care crisis is back, There is intensifying sentiment across the country that universal coverage is our only way out. The labor movement has used historically such opportunities for change to win health benefits at the bargaining table and strengthen the social safety net. Eighty years of incremental victories and many failed attempts at major health reform have taught labor a crucial lesson: we must build a powerful grassroots movement to drive our effort to achieve universal coverage, or it is doomed to be corrupted by those wedded to the status quo. Now is the right time for reform.

Abstract: The extent of coverage provided by a country's health services is directly related to the level of development of that country's democratic process (and its power relations). The United States is the only developed country whose government does not guarantee access to health care for its citizens. It is also the developed country with the least representative and most insufficient democratic institutions, owing to the constitutional framework of the political system, the privatization of the electoral process, and the enormous power of corporate interests in both the media and the political process. As international experience shows, without a strong labor-based movement willing to be radical in its protests, a universal health care program will never be accepted by the US establishment.

Abstract: South Korea is one of the world's most rapidly industrializing countries. Along with industrialization has come universal health insurance. Within the span of 12 years, South Korea went from private voluntary health insurance to government-mandated universal coverage. Since 1997, with the intervention of the International Monetary Fund, Korean national health insurance (NHI) has experienced deficits and disruption. However, there are lessons to be drawn for the United States from the Korean NHI experience.
