Title: PSROs in dentistry
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Friedman, J.W.
Year: 1975
Volume: 65
Issue: 12
Pages: 1298-1303
Abstract: Although the discussion of Professional Standards Review Organizations (PSROs) has been directed almost entirely to medical care, dentistry will not only become part of the process, it can also lead the way. This paper presents a brief review of the background of dental PSROs and the experience of U.S. Administrators as a prototype PSRO, including a description of the quality assurance system and data based on 2 yr experience. The significance of this paper is the demonstration that effective implementation of PSRO principles in dentistry will not only improve the quality of dental care programs but will also pay for itself by eliminating unnecessary and excessive services.

Title: Health planning in Latin America
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Garcia Gutierrez, J.L.

Issue: 10
Pages: 1047-1049
Abstract: Health planning in Latin America became an organized activity with the Charter of Punta del Este in 1961. The charter's 10-Year Public Health Program set forth a series of objectives that stressed international cooperation, the link of public health with economic development, and assistance from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the U.N. through Economic Commission for Latin America. The basis for most planning efforts in the region has been the PAHO/Center for Development Studies (CENDES) method, a joint venture of WHO and the Central University of Venezuela. This methodology suggests health programs that are organized from the bottom up beginning with "program areas" for populations that lie not more than 2 hours from a health clinic. The program areas comprise a regional area, which in turn is serviced by specialized clinics not affordable in program areas. The regional areas serve as the building blocks for the national programs. Beginning in 1963, several countries undertook planning activities using the PAHO/CENDES procedures. In many countries, however, the evolution of the planning process did not measure up to the expectations of 1961; only a few countries actually completed the program cycle. The problems confronted by these programs demonstrated that health planning has to be more than the intermittent exercise of preparing plans and documents.

Title: The district health center in Japan. History, services, and future development
Journal: American Journal of Public Health

Pages: 58-62
Abstract: The Jpanese public health system has many remarkable achievements to its credit. The impressive strides in tuberculosis control and the complete elimination of cholera are only 2 of those which can be mentioned. However, as Japan moves into its mature capitalist period, with infectious diseases under control, low crude and infant mortality rates (6.8 per 1,000 and 14.2 per 1,000, respectively, in 1969), and an aging population, the chronic, degenerative diseases and killers are becoming more prevalent. In addition, as is well known, environmental pollution is an extremely serious problem in Japan. Because of the rapid urbanization as well as industrialization in recent years, public health practice in the country is facing a new phase aiming at comprehensive health care for the community. Consequently, great emphasis of the Department's activity has been laid on teaching and research to meet the changing needs in public health pratice. Main research fields under study in the past several years are: comprehensive health service systems; community health planning; training, education and recruitment of public health personnel; history of public health practice; evaluation of health education; educational effects of community organization for health; social health insurance; medical care security; and medical social work. One of the major interests is in the integration of preventive and treatment services and the reorganization of district health centers into polyclinics serving defined populations, on the one hand and community health planning and health information centers on the other hand.

Issue: 1
Pages: 77-78
Abstract: A great deal of emphasis has been placed on the importance of contraception in resolving the problems of a surplus of free roaming pets. There is a clear danger that contraception may be stressed at the expense of programs to educate owners of the responsibilities of pet ownership and legislation and enforcement to prevent irresponsible ownership. Pets which are responsibly cared for and controlled do not mate promiscuously. Sterile pets which are free to roam at will still bite, create nuisances and disturbances, damage property, spread disease, cause traffic accidents, pollute the environment, and become ill, die and create the need to destroy life. Nonetheless, it is a fact that contraception will reduce these problems, and appropriate contraception is a part of responsible ownership. A variety of contraceptive technologies for controlling reproduction in pets are in various stages of research, development, or availability. Some of these are described and evaluated.

Title: Menstrual regulation in family planning services

Abstract: Fertility control by means of menstrual regulation is discussed in the context of family planning programs. Its efficacy, efficiency, safety, cost effectiveness, and acceptability are evaluated. Menstrual regulation is the term applied to any treatment which is administered within 14 days of a missed menstrual period to ensure that a woman either is not pregnant or does not remain pregnant. Because pregnancy tests are not accurate at this stage of pregnancy, it cannot be reliably determined whether a woman is pregnant prior to the procedure. The most common method of treatment is vacuum aspiration using a small diameter, clear plastic, flexible cannula. Neither dilation of the cervix nor anesthesia is usually required. Curetting the uterus for delayed periods has been performed for at least a century under the guise of 'dry cupping' or diagnostic endometrial biopsy to investigate amenorrhea. Many physicians have also had the experience of missing the ovum and having a pregnancy continue. Unfortunately, because these procedures were performed under guises, their effectiveness and complication rates for use in women with amenorrhea are unknown. The first systematic studies of the practicability of menstrual regulation were initiated by the International Fertility Research Program in 1972. Menstrual regulation appears to be a safe, effective, and economical method of fertility control. Its increased safety compared to first trimester abortion establishes menstrual regulation by vacuum aspiraion for treatment of up to 14 days missed menstrual period as probably better medical practice than waiting to confirm the presence of a pregnancy. Because it is a postconceptive method, menstrual regulation has potential in family planning services both as a recruitment service and for the treatment of contraceptive failures. Its use as an only method of fertility control is being studied. The acceptance of this new family planning service will primarily depend on its availability, dissemination of information about the service, and the ability of women freely to avail themselves of the service without delay. Although long term effects of single and repeated use of menstrual regulation are not known, its immediate complications are few and it can be recommended as a useful addition to present fertility control methods in family planning programs.

Title: Early reconception and contraceptive use among black teenage girls after an illegitimate birth
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Graves, W.L.

Volume: 65

Pages: 738-740
Abstract: Contraceptive continuation and early reconception rates among a group of low income, black, teenage primiparous women were examined. Subjects who subsequently married following their first pregnancy were significantly more likely to conceive again within 1 yr, but when the association was examined by method of contraception chosen, the difference persisted only for those who selected oral contraceptives. There was no association between method of contraception chosen and subsequent marriage within 2 yr postpartum, although patients who did not marry but reported at the time of delivery that they had plans to marry were more likely to choose oral contraceptives. Selection of the IUD was associated with a set of social situational factors which suggest that family pressures may be an important factor in the choice of this method of contraception. Active use of contraception at 1 yr does not appear to be related to social situational factors in this population. Psychological attributes seem to be more critical. It was shown that passivity was related to continued use of the IUD and discontinued use of oral contraceptives.

Abstract: An essential component of a day care service is a meaningful health care program to protect, maintain, and improv the health of each child enrolled. The lack of adequate programs to promote these goals provides a unique opportunity for organizers of health care to develop and evaluate innovative health services to these predominatly preschool children. A pediatric Ambulatory Service in Brooklyn has undertaken the task of developing a health program for a day care children in the community. In the first phase a pilot health program was established and evaluated at one day care center. The experience gathered from the project has led to the development of a program serving the health care needs of children and their siblings in a cluster of day care centers in the community.

Abstract: Computer control of school nursing records for the purposes of health planning and follow up, an important aspect of a large scale health information system, is described and evaluated. This paper represents an experiment in making school health records more responsive to the needs of school nurses, so that they in turn can be more responsive to the needs of the children. The availability of modern computer technology and the obsolete systems of record keeping in some school health programs indicated an obligation to bring these two areas together. In the attempt to bridge the gap between the two diverse disciplines of computer methods and school nursing, considerable learning had to take place in both areas. Useful sources in the school nursing field are listed in the references.

Pages: 175-177
Abstract: The emphasis of the last decades on a systems approach to planning should foster adequate consideration, in health planning, of the influence of nonhealth factors on health conditions and services. However, the health professions, sometimes on 'international standards' grounds of questionable relevance, have been rather long in recognizing that medical care in the developing world is not only an 'exotic byproduct' of Western practices. The importance of going beyond the traditional tropical medicine concerns has been indicated: the main determinant of the pattern of medical care in developing countries is poverty rather than a warm climate. This is true not only of medical care, but also to a large extent of the health problems. Others have aimed at fostering the same awareness, as have technical assistance agencies like WHO. Yet, it still needs to be emphasized that most of the ills of public health importance in developing countries are basically socioenvironmental in nature.

Title: A critical reassessment of the evidence bearing on smoking as the cause of lung cancer
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Sterling, T.D.
Year: 1975
Volume: 65
Issue: 9
Pages: 939-953
Abstract: Since population statistics have contributed significantly to the belief that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer, perhaps one should start by asking how population surveys and statistical studies can contribute to the understanding of the possibly complex causes of lung cancer or, in fact, any cancer? This question is basic since it includes cigarette smoking as one of the possible antecedents but does not ignore the rich evidence implicating others. If it is true that existing population studies clearly indicate that cigarette smoking is the major cause of lung cancer, then additional large and expensive population surveys to uncover other causes may not be warranted. On the other hand, if this general conclusion is not acceptable, then the groundwork may be laid for a much more inclusive population study. It is generally believed that existing evidence has established that smoking is a major cause of lung cancer. This report has undertaken to probe this belief - not to provoke or to please, but to dissect and to analyze. Because one adopts an analytical attitude, it may be difficult to avoid the impression that the focus of this paper is on the critical side. The voluminous research on smoking and lung cancer contains many good as well as bad points. While a critical analysis tends to bring out inadequacies, this should not be taken to imply that none of the past studies are of value. Quite to the contrary: many able investigators have studied this difficult problem with great care and have gathered valuable data, and their analyses have significantly contributed to the understanding of human disease. A critical analysis offers an objective framework for evaluating widely used research methods and analytic procedures but, unfortunately, without singling out individual good or bad points or emphasizing how the work of many of these scientists has enriched our knowledge. Bearing in mind these limitations, there is yet one other pressing need to closely analyze the statistical studies and population surveys of the effects of smoking. Unfortunately, conventional procedures based largely on animal studies are becoming increasingly inadequate for determining the toxicity of any consumed product or of a widespread pollutant. Continuing surveys of human populations may be the major method for monitoring the health of large communities and protecting men from the untoward effects of the byproducts of his many activities. The smoking and health population studies form a model on how such surveys may be conducted. If this model is invalid and possibly leads to misleading conclusions, as many respected statisticians and scientists have claimed, then incalculable damage may result in the long run if the shortcomings in this model are not made public.

Abstract: Solid waste disposal is one of the most hazardous occupations in the United States. Almost no good epidemiological information is available on the subject. There are obvious preventive measures which can and should be undertaken immediately. These include the following: safety education courses should be offered, starting with top management personnel, and extending down to every supervisory level and to field personnel; equipment must be evaluated from a human factors engineering standpoint, so that the equipment is made to fit the worker's capacities; the work environment must be further evaluated and tested on a continuous basis in terms of hazardous conditions; manpower needs and schedules should be reevaluated and altered in an effort to avoid excessive overtime; the basic work procedures of solid waste disposal must be changed to hasten mechanization and containerization. Solid wastes must be tested in order to evaluate community and work exposures to organisms and chemicals in terms of biological effect. Finally, the finding of a significantly higher incidence of coronary disease in uniformed sanitationmen is surprising. An epidemiological study is necessary in an attempt to identify causative factors. The possibility of involvement of acute and/or chronic carbon monoxide exposure in the etiology of coronary diseases must be investigated.

Abstract: Black lung, only recently recognised in the US as an occupational disease in coal miners, has taken a toll of something like 200,000 lives in death and disablement. Other occupational diseases affect high proportions of the work force but only 10% of job related disorders are recorded by the government. A plea is made for more protection in the workplace and for adequate compensation for injured and disabled workers.

Pages: 1315-1318
Abstract: It is suggested that physicians give dog related zoonoses a higher index of suspicion, and include pet ownership or contact as part of the patient's history. It is also time for the social and legislative forces of society to respond humanely, but strictly, by exercising greater control over the size of the dog population, the dogs' freedom to roam, and their promiscuous defecation. The dog should not be considered a pest to expel from society. In fact, the controls necessary to safeguard the public would also benefit the canine population. Dogs that are under direct supervision or control are healthier, live longer, and appear to be better adjusted, perhaps because a pet's real social group includes its owner. The unsafe aspects of livestock and wildlife populations have been made known to those in contact with them. It is now time for urban dwellers as well to have a more balanced view of the man dog relationship so that man and dog can live together in health and peace.

Title: Approaches to an epidemiology of health
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Terris, M.

Volume: 65
Issue: 10
Pages: 1037-1045
Abstract: A new definition of health and its relation to disease and illness is presented, and various approaches to epidemiological studies of health are discussed. The expanded definition reflects a major change in epidemiological thinking and practice. As the infectious diseases declined in the industrialized countries, it became increasingly clear that the noninfectious diseases were the most important causes of illness, disability, and death. Epidemiologists began to shift their efforts in this direction, and the chronic diseases have become the dominant field of epidemiological research in these countries. The new definition, however, no longer suffices, for the scope of epidemiological investigation has broadened beyond its boundaries. For one thing, the definition does not include trauma which, as a result of war and more limited forms of assault, as well as accidents and suicidal attempts, accounts for a considerable part of morbidity and mortality. Epidemiological studies of trauma, particularly that due to accidents and suicide, have been carried out in increasing numbers during the past several decades and need to be included in the conceptual framework of modern epidemiology. The purpose of this paper is to attempt to clarify the concepts and interrelations of health, illness, and disease; to demonstrate that the epidemiology of health is not a luxury or a minor concern but rather an area of crucial significance to the majority of the world's population; and to indicate the variety of approaches that have been used in its scientific pursuit. Much more can and will be done in the scientific development of an epidemiology of health. A precondition, however, is the casting off of the narrow viewpoints and constricting traditions which hinder interest and activity in this field.

Abstract: Hair samples were collected from several socioeconomic and ethnic groups in Japan and from 2 groups (vegetarians vs nonvegetarians) in India. The samples were analyzed for the amount of total mercury and methylmercury. A large amount of mercury in the hair of molybdenum refinery workers who were exposed to mercury vapor was detected. However, the amount of methylmercury in them was almost in the normal range. This suggests that the abnormal amount of mercury found in hair samples can be attributed to the mercurial contamination to which they have been exposed. On the other hand, a large amount of mercury was detected in the hair of Minamata patients and the ratio of methylmercury to total mercury in hair samples from this group was significantly larger than that in mercury workers who had heavy mercury exposure. This is evidence that the Minamata patients absorbed methylmercury by the gastrointestinal route through the ingestion of fish. It is suggested in this report that the amount of fish consumed significantly influences the mercury content in scalp hair, particularly the methylmercury content. Consequently, the actual or potential health hazards, particularly from a low level of alkylmercury contained in marine products caught in a natural environment, urgently require further study. The importance of determining the ratio of methylmercury to the total mercury in biological specimens for an assessment of mercury absorption is also emphasized. This means that the significance of the amount of mercury in hair specimens should not be evaluated merely by the total amount of mercury; determination of the ratio of methylmercury to total mercury is necessary.

Year: 1975
Volume: 65
Issue: 10
Abstract: This article assembles ideas, experience and advice drawn from over 100 health education programs. Seventeen of them were examined in fine detail at 3 regional workshops. The major issues arising out of these studies were then further reviewed by top experts in health related fields, who added their own experience and interpretation at the National Conference on Consumer Health Education in October, 1974. Publication of the work of this Project has a double purpose: to help those already busy carrying out health education programs, and to help the many others who, in the inevitable course of health care progress, will soon become involved with health education, administering it, paying for it, or using it. The material presented was developed over the past 3 yr under the guidance of a General Advisory Committee, whose members were appointed by the Health Education Section of the American Public Health Association and the Society for Public Health Education. The committee became involved in this effort as a response to a request asking how a particular drug company could best contribute to the health education of low income and minority consumers.

Abstract: The term "health planning" is defined as the attempt to determine the health needs and wants of a population and to design and implement the means of meeting them. The tragedy of Latin American health planning has been that the wisdom of their approach, which seeks to concern health consumers first rather than cater to the avarice of health producers as is done in the U.S., has not been matchable by the level of technological and political sophistication needed to bring it off. Thus, whenever a Latin American country sought unilateral assistan ce, their own farsighted goals of health for their people have often bee n forced into a secondary place by guidance from shortsighted but technically proficient spokesmen of ultrasophisticated medical care. A huge portion of all health dollars currently serve a small portion of the populace in many countries assisted by the U.S. American health professionals would be well advised to participate actively in the studies and deliberations of Latin American planners, whose wisdom has been ignored for too long.

This study suggests the usefulness of routine stool examinations for screening unsuspected parasitosis in selected urban populations with high rate of infection and poor hygienic standards, even outside tropical endemic areas.

Abstract: Demonstration of rubella antibody has become, in recent years, one of the tests most frequently requested of virus diagnostic laboratories. The hemagglutination inhibition (HI) technique described in 1967 by Stewart et al is sensitive, reproducible, convenient, and economic and commercial availability of diagnostic kits enables laboratories to offer this test without costly facilities for maintenance of cell cultures, preparation of antigen, etc. Recognizing the need for a standardized procedure for the rubella HI test, the United States Public Health Service appointed a committee to evaluate the reproducibility and sensitivity of the various procedures in current use. A report published in 1970 recommended that nonspecific inhibitors be removed by the use of manganese chloride and heparin or, as an 'acceptable alternative' by the calcium chloride dextran sulfate method. Fresh red blood cells from 1 to 3 day old unfed chicks or from geese were chosen as the erythrocytes for the test. In 1971, however, most laboratories in New York State did not follow this procedure, which has not been mandated by federal or state laws or regulations. The majority used the kaolin method for removal of inhibitors; only a few laboratories used the specified erythrocytes. This paper describes the implementation of the New York State rubella proficiency testing program and the experience gained during the first 4 yr of its operation.

Abstract: The increasing concern and interest in the health delivery system in the United States has placed the health system planners in a difficult position. They are inadequately prepared, in many cases, to deal with the management techniques that have been designed for use with system problems. This situation has been compounded by the failure, until recently, of educational programs to train new health professionals in these techniques. Computer simulation is a technique that allows the planners dynamic feedback on their proposed plans. This same technique provides the planning student with a better understanding of the systems planning process.

Pages: 394-396
Abstract: Administration and supervision of the school nursing program should come from health services. This means first, that the preferred jurisdiction emanates from the board of health and, secondly, that the actual management and supervision of school nursing practice falls to someone from the health community, i.e., a supervising school nurse or a school physician. In such an arrangement there will tend to be less domination by educational managers, specifically, school principals. While it would be naive to assume that the school principal will ever cease to be a major factor in the determination of the school nursing role, the opportunities for intervention and direction will be considerably less in the proposed administrative arrangement.

Abstract: There is at present a growing realization that the rehabilitation of a committed drug user is difficult even if the user is well motivated, and it almost always fails if the user is not motivated. These therapeutic realities have resulted in a growing insistence on preventive education efforts both within the schools and in the community. The demands for preventive education have been accompanied by an increasing focus on methods of apprehending and punishing the pushers. In this brief review, the author comments on some of the current approaches.

Abstract: Possible causes for a decline in the infant mortality rate in the USA during the late 1960s are proposed and examined statistically. 27% of the decline for 1965 to 1972 is attributable solely to shifts in age of mother and birth order of infant. Individual 'family planning' has thus made a greater contribution to the reduction of infant mortality than has been previously realized.

Abstract: Land disposal of domestic wastewater has been practiced on a large scale in Europe for several decades, mainly for the purpose of irrigating crops or pasture. Recently, however, spray irrigation, one form of land disposal, has taken on new dimensions as it is considered a means of disposal of wastewaters which heretofore have been discharged directly to streams or lakes. The paper is a review of the health and hygiene aspects of wastewater treatment or wastewater reclamation by spray irrigation. Although the discussion is limited to spray irrigation because of its current popularity among communities and sanitary engineers, many of the basic principles are applicable to the other methods of land disposal such as surface flooding and ridge and furrow irrigation. The following conclusions relative to the health and hygiene effects of spray irrigation land disposal of wastewater can be drawn: Many of the detrimental health and hygiene aspects of land disposal should be significantly reduced by proper wastewater pretreatment including secondary treatment, filtration, and complete disinfection. By choosing a land disposal site that has from 5 to 10 ft of continuous fine soil, biological contamination of ground water can be avoided. The probability of inhaling pathogenic aerosols near a spray irrigation site may be significant. If ponding results in spray irrigation areas, mosquito breeding is enhanced. In areas where land disposal is the first step in a water recycle program, total dissolved solids, sodium, and nitrate nitrogen buildup in the ground water supply can be a problem. (44 references.)

Abstract: Health maintenance organizations (HMOs), by their stated purpose and nature, have a necessary and central involvement with health education. The specific characteristics of any HMO determine the extend and quality of health education. An HMO has the responsibility to identify its educational objectives, as well as the educational components of any of its other objectives. The more professional the educational guidance, the better it is integrated into the organization, and the greater its financial and administrative support, the more likely will be the success in achieving objectives. Every HMO has the need and potential for a health education effort. The extent and quality of that effort will reflect the mix of administrative philosophy, organizational characteristics, the degree to which professional educators are involved, and the amount and stability of financial support.

Abstract: During the last few years the programming of assistance given by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and World Health Organization (WHO) to the countries in the Americas has been closely linked to the health planning process. This relationship has developed through joint use by the Ministries of Health and PAHO of a medium term approach to planning called the ''Quadrennial Projections System''. Essentially a somewhat simplified planning process that utilizes data known to be readily available in all of the countries, this procedure has been employed for the last few years by PAHO and the Ministries of Health for the joint planning of external aid to the countries, with special references to PAHO/WHO.

Abstract: Following an incident in which eight children became ill from carbon monoxide in a school bus, an investigation was made of CO levels in school buses in the Seattle area. The procedure selected for the evaluation was to test a large number of buses at a nearby ski resort. On the day selected for the sampling over 200 buses arrived, bringing school children from a number of school districts in the Seattle area for skiing lessons. As they arrived, 33 buses were checked immediately to determine in transit levels of CO. Four of the 33 buses had CO levels in excess of Environmental Protection Agency maximum allowable concentrations for an 8 hr exposure. As the buses sat idling in the parking lot, 65 of them were tested, during the lunch hour when the students returned to the buses to have their lunch and to rest. Two buses had nearly 3 times the concentration of CO permitted by the EPA for a 1 hr exposure. A total of seven buses (10 per cent) had concentrations of CO not permitted by the EPA for more than a 1 hr period. Altogether there were 24 buses (36 per cent) that had levels of CO in excess of EPA standards for an 8 hr exposure. As a result of these determinations and other observations a number of recommendations were made to reduce the hazard of exposure to carbon monoxide in school buses.

Abstract: An index to measure quality of dental restorative care was devised and utilized on a population of 838 Caucasian school children in a large midwestern city. Quality was measured using a 4 point scale. All restorations present were considered as part of the entire mouth. Quality was tested in relation to socioeconomic status. Based on this index the problem of poor quality dental restorations is significant and not necessarily related to socioeconomic status as represented by income or education. Evidence of high quality dentistry as evidenced by stainless steel crowns, space maintainers, and orthodontic appliances was limited to children whose families reported incomes over $6,000. Further use of this quality index is recommended to improve and refine measurements in the area of dental care.

Abstract: In recent years nursing personnel associated with a County Health Department have become involved in efforts to assess the effectiveness of their services, with particular emphasis on determining the benefits to the populations they serve. The present study was developed in response to questions concerning whether the skills of professional nurses were being utilized to best advantage within the school system. It was decided that identification of children with a past record of high absence would be a reasonable way of defining a group of children with a high risk of future episodes of illness and possibly a high prevalence of basic health problems. Since it was anticipated that children so defined could benefit from nursing service, it was concluded that high absence children constituted an appropriate risk group to which nursing services could be profitably directed. This group was therefore selected for the pilot program. The major objectives of the study were to consider the utility of directing nursing services to a defined risk group and to document the results of the experience in terms of patient outcomes, specifically, change in absence experience. The basic working hypothesis was that focused nursing attention would be positively associated with a reduction in days absent. From the perspective of the service agency some of the concomitant benefits from the study are: the methodology, using absence as an indicator, suggests a practical approach to identification of a high risk population; the school health program can be planned to further explore emphasis on prevention through selected priorities rather than continuing to be crisis oriented; and efforts can be directed toward development of improved documentation of nursing intervention not only to provide an improved data base for evaluation but also to meet the current demand for accountability. In addition to providing a meaningful experience in program evaluation for nursing staff within the health department, participation in the study promoted more effective communication between the school system and the health department which share joint responsibility for the school health program.

Abstract: Some of the recent changes in the schools of public health include: an increasing number of schools and of graduates; a decrease in both the awarding of the MPH degree as compared with other masters degrees, and the DrPH degree as compared with the PhD; a trend toward lengthening the time for achieving the MPH degree; an increase in part time study for graduate degrees; institution of undergraduate programs and external masters degree programs; a thrust toward greater continuing education activities; and a broadened base for the student population in terms of the heterogeneity of professional backgrounds and prior experience, a wider age range with more younger students, more women students, fewer foreign students, and an increase in minority representation.

Abstract: In 1971, drug use by U.S. servicemen in Vietnam had, by all estimates, reached epidemic proportions. A follow up study of returning Army enlisted men was carried out in order to facilitate planning of programs for these soldiers and to gain insight concerning the natural history of drug use and abuse, when drugs are readily available to young men from all types of social backgrounds. Findings on the permanence of Vietnam drug addiction are presented.

Title: Developing objectives in community mental health planning
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Bachrach, L.L.
Year: 1974
Volume: 64
Issue: 12
Pages: 1162-1163
Abstract: When several administratively independent agencies are to be involved in the development of a community mental health plan, a number of interagency communications difficulties may potentially arise. An effective mental health plan which expresses and endeavors to implement the aims of several organizations must have a foundation which represents the consensus of all of the participating units. At the same time, it must have enough flexibility to allow for the different populations served by, and the various aims, needs, and resources of, the separate organizations. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a conceptual framework for embarking on the design of objectives for a community mental health plan, where a number of administratively independent facilities provide mental health services to the population.

Title: Drug use during and after high school: results of a national longitudinal study
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Johnston, L.D.
Year: 1974
Volume: 64
Issue: S1
Pages: 29-37
Abstract: Findings indicate that the amount of nonaddictive illegal drug use has been much less for American young people than reports in the media had suggested during the period in question, and that the relationships between nonaddictive drug use and delinquency (as well as between drug use and academic performance) is far less serious than commonly has been assumed by the public. Clearly there has been an important generational change in this area, with an increasing proportion of American youth being interested in, and tolerant of, the use of psychoactive drugs. However, as of mid 1970 the vast majority of the age group studied were still cautious about illegal drugs and not deeply involved in them; and many of those who were involved made important distinctions between the different drugs and the different degrees of usage. In fact, from the perspective of health and public safety one of the most important findings about levels of drug use may be the degree to which American young people are continuing to adhere to certain traditional practices, namely, the consumption of alcohol and cigarettes on a major scale. Even though the best available evidence suggests that absolute levels of illicit drug use may be quite a bit higher now than was observed for the high school class of 1969, the authors expect that most of the relationships observed in this study could be extrapolated to more recent cohorts of high school and college students. Among those relationships are that between drug use and delinquency, and that between drug use and academic performance. Still a third is the relationship of certain drugs to membership in the counter culture. A developmental trend, which also would be expected to hold up in the present, is the substantial increase in the use of both licit and illicit drugs which occurs in the year following high school graduation, particularly in the sectors which are most age segregated, such as military service and college. Finally, note should be made again of the intriguing finding that there exists a general orientation toward psychoactive substances, both licit and illicit, which can explain some of the variance in all of the drug attitude and drug behavior variables included here, and which causes them all to be positively associated to some degree. Discovering the causes of this general orientation, which has been replicated in a number of other studies, remains a serious challenge to researchers in the field.

Author-Name: Gearing, F.R.

Pages: 44-50
Abstract: In a cohort of 1,230 patients admitted to Methadone Maintenance Treatment between 1964 and 1968, 770 (63%) continued in treatment at the end of the study period, December 31, 1973. The total cohort had accumulated over 58,000 person months in treatment. During this period, the percentage of patients who could be classified as socially productive rose from 36% to 72%, and there was a decline in unemployment from 64% to 28%. Among those in treatment at the end of the study period who were unemployed on admission 75% were considered socially productive after 5 or more yr of observation. Antisocial behavior as measured by arrests and incarcerations in the full cohort decreased from 201 per 100 person yr to 1.24, and approximately 85% of those who remained in treatment were completely arrest free, despite their previous history of criminal activity. Among those who left the program during the study period, on whom follow up information was available evidence of return to heroin use was high, but 59 (15%) were reported to be in an abstinence program.

Abstract: In this study of 408 healthy school age children, selected from the first, third, and fifth grades, who responsed to questionnaires on illness and general anxiety, it was found that these children possessed different views of illness than do ill hospitalized children. Analysis of the data indicated that children who scored high on the general anxiety test also scored high on the illness anxiety test. Only these anxious children perceived illness as a possible punishment for their misbehavior and saw it as a disruptive force in their lives. Healthy, nonanxious children frankly rejected to the possibility that misbehavior caused illness, or that their parent's reactions were negative, or that illness was disruptive to their lives.

Title: A hinge of history. Health and environment
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Metzler, D.F.
Year: 1974
Volume: 64
Issue: 12
Pages: 1160-1161
Abstract: Concern with population levels, environmental quality, resource conservation, and the quality of life can be considered as facets of a single problem. This has been described as 'the hinge of history, on which man's long term future may depend'. The control of environment quality is central to the health and well-being of man. The greatest hope for health improvement lies in an understanding of how the environment contributes to disease in man, and conversely, how it can be managed to provide the greatest improvement in human health. It is imperative that we recognize how little we know and how badly we need scientific understanding of the nature and magnitude of environmental problems. Further, scientists must avoid the temptation to exaggerate the actual deterioration of the environment and refrain from making unreasonable demands for environmental controls, however well intentioned. Recognizing the need for our cooperative services, and accepting the responsibility for rational action, a multidisciplinary professional group should concentrate its efforts in research and program development, influence on legislation, environmental education, research into water and air pollution control and solid waste management and, finally, pesticide control.

Abstract: New heroin use peaked in major U.S. cities around 1968, leading to a theory of a simultaneous national 'epidemic'. Analysis of treatment data does not support this theory. Instead, peak use is shown to have shifted from larger to smaller cities and is still occurring in places under 400,000 population.

Abstract: The position of the American Pharmaceutical Association supporting the Supreme Court decision on abortion is reaffirmed and organized efforts to reverse the rulings are surveyed. The cases of "Roe v. Wade" and "Doe v. Bolton", which were leading cases in the Supreme Court decision, are reviewed with respect to their opinions and guiding recommendations. The positive health effects of abortion such as reduced maternal mortality rates are mentioned and it is suggested that since Catholic women aborting constitute a greater proportion of abortees compared to the proportion of Catholics in the general population, that women of all faiths will resort to abortion if confronted with an unwanted pregnancy.

Abstract: Using aggregate national data, an attempt was made in 1972 to estimate the numbers of persons who will need each of the fertility-related services (e.g., prenatal and postnatal care for wanted pregnancies, medical care of infant in its first year fertility limitation, and medical treatment of infertility) between then and 1978, and the costs of providing them. The preliminary model was later refined utilizing additional sources of data are needed to help the health care system assist individual members of the community to achieve their family formation goals. The paper includes discussions of the sorts of data that are needed and the reasons for this need, the present sources of data (in terms of providers, households, payers, and carriers), and the types of data gaps (absence, insufficient disaggregation, lack of relatedness, in complete specification). The author contends that attention to the various gaps would increase the potential of our important national surveys to produce data on numbers in need of fertility-related health services, etc. Greater comparability in questions asked and in methods of analyzing and presenting the responses could be achieved at little sacrifice of the basic purposes for which the systems were created. Recommendation is made that a step be taken to convene a small conference of key personnel working on these systems to explore the gaps and incompatibilities, propose means of overcoming them, and identify needed special studies.

Abstract: This study of 173 men who received vasectomies from one urologist shows the male seeking a vasectomy from this clinic is white, middle class, well educated, married once, median age of 36, and with 2 to 3 children. Three quarters of the men had used the condom and found it bothersome. The same number had also used the pill and various other methods of contraception without satisfaction. Other studies have shown economic reasons as the main factor leading to vasectomy whereas this one revealed freedom from anxiety about possible conception and sexual pleasure as the primary reasons. The concern for sexual freedom is considered characteristic of our present culture and probably closely associated with the pill itself. Since the pill is not related as closely with the sex act as other methods of contraception it has given couples the freedom to enjoy sex. Since the late 1960s when the media began publishing the side effects from the pill our society has been seeking a replacement method that will allow that freedom to remain. This group will continue to be followed along with other planned studies, to see if their contraceptive vasectomy has made any changes in their lives.

Title: Abortion attitudes among nurses and social workers.

Volume: 64

Pages: 438-441
Abstract: A survey of attitudes toward abortion was conducted among nurses and social workers in Tennessee. It was found that, even when relevant background characteristics were similar, social workers were more liberal toward abortion than nurses. It is suggested that the difference may result from differences in goals and types of client contact within the 2 professions. Because social workers aim at helping clients "cope" with many problematic situations and nurses aim at preserving patients' health, social work involves contact with a greater part of clients' lives than nursing. Nurses tend to view abortion as a medical procedure while social workers may consider it an appropriate procedure for various social, economic, and psychological reasons. Social workers see clients in normal life situations but nurses see them under specialized medical conditions in clinics or hospitals. It is more likely that social workers would understand the benefit an abortion could provide to a client. It is speculated that, in the future, social workers will refer poor clients to clinics or hospitals for abortions they feel are necessary and nurses will discourage or turn away many of these clients.

Title: The potential for paramedical personnel in family planning. An analysis based on the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare 5-year Plan for Family Planning Services.
Journal: American Journal of Public Health

Year: 1974
Volume: 64
Issue: 1
Pages: 27-31
Abstract: The use of paramedical personnel in family planning services within the structure of the 5-year Plan for Family Planning Services and Population Research Programs submitted to Congress by the Secretary of HEW in 1971 was explored. The Plan works within the existing health care system through the basic module of a 4-hr 8-times weekly clinic session. The paramedical family planning specialist can perform breast and pelvic examinations, counsel, perform specialized gynecological procedures, and recognize a normal physical examination. In a series of 6000 comparative physical examinations, the family planning specialist demonstrates an acceptable level of accuracy in the description of physical examination findings of the breast and pelvis. Over 3000 IUDs were inserted by family planning specialists with no major complications. In a series of 10,582 patients, 43.8% preferred the specialists, 55.6% had no preferrence, .6% preferred care by a physician. In a series of 11,373 patients, family planning specialists provided care to 80% of the patients without the need for the involvement of a physician. Registered nurses had a consultation rate of 11.4%, nonregistered nurses, 19.6%. An optional distribution of of patients per specialist per session is 3 new patients, 4 returning patients with examination, 2 returning without examination (total 3 hr 10 min for patient card during a 4-hr clinic). The optimal patient load and the expected proportion of return visits (63% will require examination, 37% will not) are similar. The various possibilities of the system with variation of physician time per clinic, number of nonregistered/registered nurses, and number of patients, or with supervision of nonregistered nurse family planning specialists by registered nurse specialists, with time required for care of patients by type of patient visit constant is explored.

Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Sirey, A.R.

Volume: 63
Issue: 10
Pages: 831-832
Abstract: In some isolated family planning services innovative uses of new professional manpower are being demonstrated. With specialized training, the paramedical personnel are performing full gynecological screening examinations under the supervision of physicians, serving as clinic administrators, and providing counseling and educative services. Currently not enough funds are being allocated to manpower development. In 1973 only 3% of federal funds for family planning services were earmarked for this endeavor. There also is an unwillingness of a large percentage of medical and health professionals to accept the potential roles of the new professionals as well as to come to grips with the concept of "consumer participation". This consumer involvement is necessary in developing a system that is responsive to the patient's needs. Training periods vary for the new professionals from a few weeks to 3 years to prepare Physicians' Assistants. In a 20 week course individuals have been trained to recognize and differentiate normal and abnormal breast and pelvic findings and to provide family planning and cancer screening services including full pelvic exams and insertion of the IUD. Over 100 new professionals who function as in-hospital family planning counselors and community education technicians in a New York City program were trained through the laboratory method approach. The key to the performance of the new professionals in the clinic is proper supervision and good communication between them and the traditionally trained professionals. Some of the dead-end restrictions which characterize so many of the new positions can be removed if efforts are made within each program to provide in-service training or released time for employees to attend seminars, workshops, of courses at suitable institutions to foster growth and mobility.

Abstract: The reproductive performance of school-age girls in 2 family planning programs is analyzed. The performance is related, after analysis, to 1) the characteristics of the programs, 2) certain preexisting characteristics of the participants, 3) the degree of their participation in 1 of the programs, and 4) other findings at 15 months postpartum. Of the 2 programs studied, the New Haven Young Mothers Program(YMP) provided medical services while the Hartford Interagency Service (IAS) did not. Family planning received vigorous attention in both the medical and social services aspects of the YMP program. The hospital clinics and private physicians seen by the IAS participants varied. Contraceptives were prescribed for 69 percent and 73 percent of those returning postpartum at the 2 non-Catholic hospitals and for only 3 percent in the Catholic Hospital, which served about half the program participants. 180 YMC girls and 160 IAC girls were included in the study initially. The samples were modified for comparison. After modification, at 15 months postpartum 18% of the girls in each group was pregnant for a second time. For the YMP group, 15 months portpartum, the only preesixting characteristic which correlated significantly with subsequent pregnancy was registration in and attendance at school: 30% of bad attenders became pregnant wheras none with good attendence did. Moving since delivery also was associated with a higher risk of rapid subsequent pregnancy. It was concluded that rapid subsequent pregnancies among schoolage mothers are associated with school status and with program participation. Effective use of oral contraceptives requires motivation. It is suggested that in some cases and IUCD should be inserted if it is acceptable to the girl. It is concluded that family planning services cannot be provided in a vacuum, especially for teen age girls, and that prescribing physicians must consider the motivation and life goals of each patient.

Abstract: The APHA recommended program guide for voluntary sterilization fails to recommend that vasectomy services establish policies for handling the pregnancies of patients' wives or consorts. stoperative absence of spermatozoa might or might not imply a successful operation, but in terms of use-effectiveness the vasectomy is a failure if pregnancy occurs. The 1st step of a policy might be to counsel abortion and tubal division n analysis; me. An alternate step might require both partners to consent to postpregnancy semen analysis and both be informed of the results. In repeated negative specimens, genetic studies on the ceptus would be required to demonstrate responsibility. licy formulated should be told to patients before the operation and informed consent obtained. An insurance policy, at small cost, might be offered to indemnify couples against costs of abortion, tubal division, or maternity care the operation had failed or not.

Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Tyler Jr., C.W.
Year: 1973
Volume: 63
Issue: 7
Pages: 573-575
Abstract: Voluntary sterilization is discussed in the light of new legal and medical developments and the guidelines of the American Public Health Association. Voluntary sterilization is legal in all 50 states, and a Presidential commission has recommended elimination of all barriers preventing access to sterilization. The Association of Voluntary Sterilization estimates that 550,000 vasectomies were performed in the United States in 1970, and new techniques of female sterilization are making the procedure increasingly safe. The position of the APHA is that sterilization is safe and effective, does not interfere with sexual pleasure, is generally irreversible, and should always be voluntary. The viability of frozen sperm later thawed for artificial insemination has been challenged by several researchers, with one study finding a successful fertilization rate of 42.6% in artificial insemination cases using frozen semen, compared with 69% for fresh semen. Various methods are being investigated to achieve a reversible vasectomy by plugging and unplugging the vas deferens. Laparoscopic tubal division for female sterilization is a new development that appears to be relatively simple and quite safe. The hospital stay is significantly decreased with this procedure. The pregnancy failure rate is about 1%, and the complication rate is about 4-5%.

Title: Numerator analysis of fertility and family planning in Maryland.
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Kruegel, D.L.
Year: 1973
Volume: 63
Issue: 6
Pages: 509-516
Abstract: The use of numerator analysis is proposed and used as a means of evaluating fertility and family planning in Maryland. The study concludes that the significant decrease in Maryland fertility since 1965 cannot be attributed only to the increase of women in organized family planning programs. No relationship is seen between family planning programs and fertility decrease. This finding may be due to methological limitations. The 3 implications that can be derived are: 1) numerator analysis alone is insufficient to evaluate family planning programs, 2) national and small area surveys of desired and expected family size and family planning continue to be needed; and 3) continued concern should be given to documenting in detail the sociocultural processes which determine fertility levels.

Title: Non-medical birth control--a neglected and promising field.
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Harvey, P.D.

Year: 1973
Volume: 63
Issue: 6
Pages: 473-475
Abstract: The need for and methods of nonmedical family planning techniques are discussed in view of the continuing popularity of nonmedical channels of supply (5-7 million out of the 10-13 million who use contraception obtain supplies through nonmedical channels) and still unmet contraceptive needs in the United States. Lack of homogeneity in the population necessitates a choice of delivery mechanisms, and the passive system of medical service in family planning suggests the potential for the marketing approach to more effectively motivate potential family planning acceptors. Direct mail as contact and mail order as supply mechanisms are 2 especially promising aspects. Suggestions for research on how donor funds might be invested to explore the potential of these channels of information and delivery include market research on attitudes regarding contraceptive methods and delivery systems, experimentation with different delivery channels, ways of providing information at crucial points in the reproductive lives of individuals, and ways of preventing unwed teenage pregnancies.

Title: Health policy and population policy--a relationship redefined.
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Jaffe, F.S.
Year: 1973
Volume: 63
Issue: 5
Pages: 401-404
Abstract: The final report of The Commission on Population Growth and the American Future presents a significant redefinition of the relationship between health and population policy, by highlighting the points of common interest between those seeking a more rational health system, those seeking rapid reduction in population growth, and the contribution each group can make to the realization of common objectives. Slower population growth can provide the opportunity to devote resources to improving the quality of life rather than merely coping with its quantity. The Commission proposes a large number of social, economic, educational and health policies and programs for action by federal, state and local governments, and the private sector. The Commission recommends a national policy and voluntary program to reduce unwanted fertility, to improve the outcome of pregnancy, and to improve the health of children. Such a policy would consist of: 1) expansion of the federal family planning project grant programs; 2) elimination of legal restrictions on access to contraceptive information; 3) liberalization of abortion laws; 4) payment by public and private health financing mechanisms of the full cost of health services related to fertility; 5) increased federal investment in fertility related research; 6) elimination of administrative restrictions on availability of voluntary sterilization; 7) development of educational programs on family planning, family life, sexuality, and population dynamics; 8) development of programs to train the required medical and paramedical personnel. The Commission has added a potent demographic justification to the health and welfare rationales upon which proposals to improve the control of fertility and the provision of fertility-related health services have been based. Health workers and health institutions will continue to bear a central responsibility for action programs to reduce unwanted fertility and slow down population growth. The added demographic justification for expansion of fertility control and fertility related health programs provides an opportunity secure support for efforts to bring about a more rational health system from those whose primary concern is population growth.

Title: Liberalized abortion and birth rates changes in Baltimore.
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Oppel, W.

Year: 1973
Volume: 63
Issue: 5
Pages: 405-408
Abstract: To investigate the effect of liberalized abortion laws, all recorded abortions and births in Baltimore City from July 1, 1970 to December 31, 1970, were compared with births from July 1, 1968 to December 31, 1968. Both black and white in-wedlock observed births were lower than expected 1970 births, but the out-of-wedlock births were higher. Both black and white in-wedlock abortion rates showed similar patterns. Out-of-wedlock abortions, which had been rising steadily for the past few decades continued to rise. The differences observed could not be attributed only to a liberalized abortion policy. There is no record of the number of illegal abortions performed in 1968, and the study did not measure changes in birthrate which might have been attributable to differences in family planning practices caused by adverse publicity about the pill. Although abortions have increased since liberalization of the law, there may still be limited access to abortion.

Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Buttery, C.M.
Year: 1973
Volume: 63
Issue: 4
Pages: 289-290
Abstract: An objection is made to the use of 12-year-old National U.S. infant mortality data to relate the possible effects of local family planning programs occurring 10 years after the data events took place. Family planning techniques and practice as well as the methods of child care, the application of public health techniques for prevention of infant deaths, the causes of infant mortality, and the availability of prenatal care have changed extensively over the last 12 years. In addition, local infant mortality data should be refined because national infant mortality data lacks homogeneity. Graphs are presented which illustrate the data differences when progressing to smaller and smaller geographic areas. Thus, extrapolations based on old infant mortality rates are useful only if significant local variations of data within state areas are taken into account.

Journal: American Journal of Public Health

Volume: 63

Pages: 95-96
Abstract: Population education should be taught in the schools, not in response to a crisis, but as a means of providing knowledge and concepts to children. This may obviate future population crises. By treating population education as a crisis reaction, the effect of education is overrepresented; teachers and students are frustrated in not achieving the goal. The National Education Association publication of 1943 called for the introduction of population education into the schools. If it had been done then, we would have less of a gap between the concern of today's students and their knowledge. The level of understanding of leaders might be higher. Policy makers would not expect immediate results from population programs.

Abstract: Personnel other than physicians are necessary to supply adequate family planning services. At the Downstate Medical Center in New York, nurse-midwifery training was employed to solve the problem. The nurse-midwife role in family planning is described, and details are provided for the program, nurse-midwife training, and the program's expansion to foreign countries with Agency for International Development assistance. Nurse-midwives are taught all phases of family planning; accepted contraceptive methods, proper methodology, accurate record keeping and follow-up of patients, demographic and economic aspects of family planning, orientation into social service problems, and clinical planning and management. They are also taught to understand basic anatomical and physiological concepts of the reproductive systems andhow to do the following gynecological procedures: determining the position, size, and shape of the uterus and adnexa, determining the cervical canal direction, sounding the uterus, recognizing gross pelvic pathology, taking vaginal and cervical smears for neoplasia and trichomonas, and performing a Papanicolaou smear, pregnancy test, or hemocrit determination. It is the responsibility of medical and nursing schools to provide these programs for training of domestic as well as foreign personnel.

Abstract: Approximately 70,000 general service patients receive postpartum and preabortal counseling on contraceptive methods each year in 30 voluntary and municipal hospitals in New York City. A survey in 1971 showed that the younger the patient, the less likely she has used contraception in the 2 years prior to pregnancy. Also, patients terminating their 1st pregnancy by birth or abortion are the least likely to have used any contraception in the last 2 years. 41% of all abortion patients said they had not used any contraceptive method in the past 2 years. 91% of those under age 15 and 66% of those ages 15-19 had not used any contraception in the last 2 years. Over 90% of all patients receiving the counseling asked to be put on a contraceptive method.

Title: Abortion counseling.

Author-Name: Asher, J.D.

Pages: 686-688
Abstract: Abortion counseling has 3 purposes: 1) to aid the applicant in making a decision about the unwanted pregnancy, 2) to help her implement the decision, and 3) to assist her in controlling her future fertility. To accomplish the 1st objective, the compulsory use of psychiatrists to prove emotional disorders has been unsatisfactory. Counseling needs to be supportive and nonjudgmental regardless of circumstances. Hostile feelings of the counselor must be suppressed. The applicant should be informed regarding the physical and emotional aspects of the abortion procedure. Also, good counseling should aim at future prevention by determining the reasons for failure that caused the unwanted pregnancy. Of importance in selecting abortion counselors are qualities described as personality traits. These include empathy, nonpossessive warmth, and genuineness. Also, maturity and flexibility are needed in allowing the woman to make the decision, particularly in cases of ambivalence and uncertainty. A program in New York City has used women counselors who themselves have had abortions. This experience alone is not sufficient, but may be significant. The counselor needs basic knowledge of sexual physiology, psychology, and contraceptive technology. Also, the counselor should be able to recognize prodromal psychiatric signs of an imminent crisis, and be able to initiate steps of prevention. Training programs vary widely. Flexibility is needed. Experience in counseling couples is important. Assistance by an experienced counselor is helpful on a continuing basis, particularly for the new counselor. Group sessions and didactic presentations are needed. To obtain acceptance of postabortal contraception may pose special problems. A history of previous psychiatric disturbance may require referral to a trained consultant. Strong religious or ethical feelings modify attitudes. The woman must not feel coerced. She should be able to integrate the experience in such a way as to prevent a recurrence.

Abstract: Pregnant young women seeking abortions were asked to evaluate their own personal situations in regard to use and knowledge of contraceptives and learning experiences that would have been helpful and appropriate for them. The study group included 115 women who received counseling at a pregnancy counseling service in the Boston metropolitan area. In addition to the routine background information obtained in the counseling session, a 3-page multiple choice questionnaire was completed by each patient as she waited for her appointment. The findings reported here are of the 80 single women, 70% of the 115. 55% of these patients were between 18 and 21 years old, and the group was predominantly middle-class. 38% had at least some higher education. 50% described their relationship with the conception partner as a continuing one in which marriage was not a consideration. 55% had never discussed contraception with a doctor. The reasons most frequently given for not using contraception were infrequency of sexual relations and dependence on the rhythm method. Regarding the preferred learning method, 48% selected as their 1st or 2nd choice a comprehensive health course with a frank presentation of sexuality and contraceptive information. Personal discussion was the next most frequently chosen method; group discussion with other young people was also on the preferred lists. 35% selected the school at all levels as their choice for the place of learning, with 30% preferring the home.

Abstract: 113 hospitalized women aged 15-44 who developed venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism after surgery, trauma, infection or immobilization were compared to 184 controls matched by race, age, marital status, date of discharge, and degree of predisposition to thromboembolism. The groups were similar in religion, education, family income and number of children, but the married cases weighed an average of 143 lb, compared to 128 for married controls. 21 cases (35%), and 16 controls (16%), had taken oral contraceptives in the month prior to hospitalization. When computed by matched pairs, the relative risk for pill users was 6.5. When computed by groups, the relative risk was 2.7. These results agreed with a previous British study of high-risk cases. The authors concur with the suggestion that the pill be discontinued 1 month prior to surgery.

Title: Trends in therapeutic abortion in San Francisco.
Journal: American Journal of Public Health

Pages: 695-699
Abstract: Positive and negative aspects of therapeutic abortion are discussed upon review of trends found in the 6201 abortions performed in San Francisco between 1968 and 1970 (since Abortion was legalized in California in 1967). On the positive side, legalized abortion appears to have reduced the septic abortion rate (68 per 1000 live births in 1967 to 22 per 1000 in 1969) indicating a decline in criminal abortion. Maternal mortality has also declined from 8 per 100,000 to just over 3 per 100,000 from 1967 to 1969. Patients requesting abortion have averaged in age from 20-24 (26% were less than 19) and approximately half have been nulliparous. 37% of teenagers had saline abortions. Negative aspects have included the increasing morbidity rate associated with saline abortion, a second-trimester method. Compared to abortions performed at 12 weeks' gestation or less (usually done by vacuum aspiration), saline abortions required 5.7% second admissions (only 1.2% of the early abortions required readmission) and necessitated transfusion 3 times as often (in 2.3% of the cases). Regardless of the procedure used, later abortion involved a greater risk of hermorrhage and infection (2.7% incidence at 5-6 weeks' gestation compared to 12.9% at 11-12 weeks). Morbidity accompanying saline abortion was similar at 15 and 20 weeks however. Fortunately a trend toward earlier abortion is indicated. (74% of abortions were by suction and 22% by saline in 1970). Hysterotomy plus tubal ligation and hysterectomy accounted for only 4% of abortions but were accompanied by hemorrhage rates of 31% and 27% respectively and had respective infection rates of 13% and 22%. Private patients received abortions 3 times more often than ward patients although ward patients were subjected to more traumatic procedures: hysterectomies for ward patients were 2.0% vs .9% for private patients; sterilization by tubal ligation following suction abortion was 3.5% vs 1.7%. Additionally, black women had later abortions more often than white patients (33% of the black women were seen after 14 weeks gestation compared to 20% of the white women). Obstructions to early abortion must be eliminated to avoid such discrepancies in opportunity. Psychiatric examinations are unnecessary and causes for administrative delays must be remedied. Cost still presents a barrier for some women. The long-term effects of abortion now suggested by data from countries such as Czechoslovakia indicate that abortion is best viewed as a back-up measure to contraception making increased sex education, counseling and contraceptive practice essential.

Abstract: In 1966 the Orleans Parish Family Planning Program was developed with the objectives of developing a family planning delivery system that identified, contacted, educated, and provided all indigent families of the metropolitan area with family planning information and services; creating this program between July 1, 1967 and June 30, 1970; and evaluating the program by measuring its impact on fertility among the target population along with its effect on the various obstacles to family health associated with no family planning. The Orleans Parish component of Family Planning, Inc., a private non-profit corporation, is the largest single component of the statewide program that began in June 1967. The Orleans Parish Family Planning Clinic System consists of 1 central clinic and 3 satellite clinics. It offers prenatal care, postpartum care, prescription and medical supervision of contraceptive methods, screening for chronic diseases, and social and medical counseling. Evaluation of this program during the 1st 2 years of its operation revealed the following: 1) 17,459 families had become active users of the program; 2) about 74% of all patients who began contraceptive use during the 1st 6 months were still using contraception after 18 months; 3) over 95% of the families are black; 4) black women between the ages of 20 and 24 have been the biggest users of the services; and 5) the probability of a black patient using the program has been 6 times greater than for a white patient of the lower socioeconomic group. The people want and are motivated to receive these services when offered in an acceptable way. Such programs can be accepted throughout the country. A system that provides information about family planning along with the means to deliver health care and family planning services is what is needed.

Journal: American Journal of Public Health

Abstract: Noneconomic factors can be critical to the outcome of an economic development program. Anyone with development experience will have no difficulty recalling instances where, despite good economic planning, failure to account for social, cultural, and/or health factors has resulted in program accomplishments which fell short of anticipation. Economists are usually ill equipped to properly evaluate and integrate noneconomic factors in development programs, and specialists are therefore required to perform these functions and coordinate with economists so that possible pitfalls are avoided and program outcomes are enhanced. Economic development is interrelated with and interdependent upon health both directly and indirectly. A carefully planned health program can help optimize a regional or national economic development effort.

Title: Socioieconomic outcomes of restricted access to abortion.
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Muller, C.

Volume: 61
Issue: 6
Pages: 1110-1118
Abstract: Such questions as the extent to which greater accessibility to abortion services affects poverty and its problems are analyzed, and proposals for identifying the socioeconomic impact of liberalized abortion laws and accessible services are developed. The number of unwanted children born is directly affected by the barriers to legal abortion. In countries that have improved access to legal abortion, the demand for the service has risen among all socioeconomic groups. Long-time family earning potential is severely effected by the defects in the timing and spacing of the birth of children, which often leads to young men and pregnant teen-agers leaving school because of the burdens of pregnancy and child support. Large family size was found in 35% of families in 1965 where the head of the household was a fully employed worker. Children born and living as psychologically rejected or unwanted children risk impaired learning and development which in turn limits future economic achievments. Research into the access of and financing of abortion services should deal with the financial needs of patient groups. The effects of nonhospital service programs, manpower needs, and the surveillance of gaps and coverage of the service needs should be prime research targets.

Title: A course in human sexuality for the college student.

Abstract: Since 1967, 5000 students at Albertus Magnus, Amherst, Brown, Dartmouth, Mt. Holyoke, Smith, and the University of Massachusetts have participated in a sex education course, "Topics in Human Sexuality." The course format is shaped by critiques of past students. A series of 6-8 lectures, delivered by the authors, covers basic areas such as psychosexual development, interpersonal relationships, sexual response, pregnancy and birth, contraception, and abortion. The students have declared a desire to focus on issues of personal sexuality rather than on topics such as demography, abnormal sexual behavior, and morals. Discussion groups, meeting after the lectures, are coeducational and led by students who have taken the course in the past or have expressed special interest in leading a group. The rather neutral ground of college allows for relatively dispassionate examination of traditional moral teaching and peer group values. Student response has been enthusiastic.

Title: United States government policy on abortion.
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Contis, G.
Author-Name: Hern, W.M.
Year: 1971
Volume: 61
Issue: 5
Pages: 1038-1041
Abstract: Federal government policy in the United States lacks uniformity, as is indicated by the fact that the Dept. of Defense permits the performance of abortion for medical and mental health reasons, the Office of Economic Opportunity states that no project funds may be used for any surgical procedure intended to result in abortion, and the Dept. of Health, Education and Welfare has no policy concerning abortion in its programs but that abortion is a reimbursable expense under Title XIX Medicaid payments in enrolled states. This ambiguity of the federal government is considered a reflection of the complexity of the issue and the lack of clear consensus concerning abortion among the American public. Factors that federal family planning officials must consider are: 1) the ethical and moral considerations that confront the individual citizen making a private decusion about abortion; 2) legal and constitutional issues, such as that of discrimination in the availability of abortion services on economic grounds; and 3) the relationship of abortion to public service needs and public health considerations, given that 1/4-1/5 of pregnancies in the United States end in legal or illegal abortion. Clandestine abortion constitutes a significant health problem, accounting for a significant proportion of maternal mortality, especially among the poor (the 1967 rate of reported mortality due to abortion with sepsis being 7 times greater for nonwhites than whites). The Office of Economic Opportunity in reassessing its current policy needs to ascertain the standards of medical care, cost projections, and logistics of providing abortion services. It is recommended that abortion services be combined with serious efforts to provide effective subsequent contraception, as abortion as an exclusive method of birth control would cost up to $2000 per year while the provision of high quality family planning services is $60-$80 per woman per year.

Title: Politics of social change: abortion reform. The role of health professionals in the legislative process.
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Pond, M.A.
Year: 1971
Volume: 61
Issue: 5
Pages: 904-909
Abstract: The role of health professionals in the legislative process of abortion reform is reviewed by examining the effect of their work as government experts, members of professional societies, individual citizen-experts, and professional advisors to consumer groups. Government experts provide a wealth of technical assistance to legislators beyond the requirements of their positions and are invaluable to the legislative process. Professional societies could also be very helpful, but are plagued by the strong conflicting opinions of their members on the controversial issues that concern the legislators. Individual volunteer citizen-experts tend to be strong proponents of a new public health cause, and emotionalism does not help the legislators in the careful weighing of alternatives. Professional advisors to consumer lobbying organizations can also profitably affect legislators to the extent of the group's organizational and popular strength. On the abortion issue, health professionals should realize the political imperatives of the issue that may seem irrelevant to them. As yet, Congress has clearly not shown an interest in federal legislation on abortion because the need for such action has not been established. The health professional's role is to competently create that need.

Abstract: Examination of abortion experience in Georgia following the passage of an abortion law based on the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code, intended to increase the availability of abortion, suggests that nonhospital abortions are still a black health problem, especially for unmarried blacks. Abortion mortality has declined for unmarried whites, married whites, and married black women. The abortion rate is highest for women under the age of 15 (falling into the rape catagory of the abortion law) and over 34 years (due to maternal physical health conditions). Maternal mental health indications are more restrictively defined in the medical community in Georgia. A comparison with several states liberalizing abortion laws demonstrates that in proportion to live births, markedly fewer hospital abortions have been performed in Georgia than in other states. Only 20 abortions were performed in Georgia each month until 1970 when the number increased to 47 due to publicity over a proposed abortion law. To reduce nonhospital abortion mortality, hospital abortions must be provided equitably to all women in need.

Abstract: In anticipation of the expected rise in demand for induced abortion (estimated to reach 500 abortions per 1000 live births within 5 to 10 years) planning should be for provision of public education, patient counseling, safe surgical care, and contraceptive counseling and services. Planning should include the establishment of health department standards with investigation of abortion complications, guidelines for individual selection of abortion procedures for each woman, and supervision of personnel. The possibility of technical training of non-professional personnel to assist in abortion, research in abortion technology, funds for the care of indigent women, and examination of the attitudes of health professionals are other topics discussed.

Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Breslow, L.

Volume: 61

Pages: 215-217
Abstract: The American Public Health Association (APHA) adopted a set of standards for abortion services at their Executive Board meeting in October 1970 which they now recommend. These recommendations cover referral and counseling, public education, surgical care, and reporting. The APHA was one of the first health organizations to recommend "that access to abortion be accepted as an important means of securing the right to space and choose the number of wanted children. To this end, restrictive laws should be repealed..." Since a number of states have now liberalized their laws abortions have increased, but the influence of economic status and race are still evident. It was estimated that approximately 8000 abortions were perfomred in the U.S. during the period 1963-1965. In the first 6 months of 1970 California alone reported 23,000 abortions in hospitals. In 1968 New York reported 5 abortions per 1000 live births in voluntary-ward hospitals and 9 abortions per 1000 live births in private hospitals. In 1970 they reported 198 and 766, respectively, per 1000 live births. This increase in abortions increases the pressure to: 1) lose regard for medical standards and increase income by decreasing quality, and 2) maintain old and outdated standards. The APHA recommends their new set of standards to help resolve these problems for those practitioners using either approach.

Abstract: The sudden rise in demand for abortion services caused by recent legislation im many states requires the establishment of service standards for the medical profession to insure that safe, accessible abortions are available at reasonable fees for all who need them. All abortion services, as a rule, should be provided in conjuction with contraceptive counseling. It is recommended by the American Public Health Association that rapid abortion referral services be provided through public health departments and voluntary agencies. Counseling is a key part of such referrals and should serve to expedite and not delay the obtaining of such services. Psychiatric consultation should not be mandatory. It is pointed out that a wide range of workers from volunteers to specialized physicians can serve as abortion counselors. Public health agencies have a responsibility to actively educate the public about abortion. Key factors in reducing the surgical risk of abortion include the skill of the physician, the proper surgical environment, and the optimum gestational period. Second trimester abortions are recommended as inpatient procedures only. Adequate surgical, pharmaceutical, laboratory, diagnostic and therapeutic facilities including emergency capabilities are minimum standards for abortion procedures. Adequately trained physicians without negative personal attitudes toward abortion should perform these procedures at resonable cost. An essential part of insuring proper abortion services is the careful and complete reporting of all abortions and the constant assimilation and evaluation of these records.
