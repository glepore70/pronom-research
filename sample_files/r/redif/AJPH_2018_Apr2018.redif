Abstract: Objectives. To test the inverse equity hypothesis, which postulates that new health interventions are initially adopted by the wealthy and thus increase inequalities—as population coverage increases, only the poorest will lag behind all other groups. Methods. We analyzed the proportion of births occurring in a health facility by wealth quintile in 286 surveys from 89 low- and middle-income countries (1993–2015) and developed an inequality pattern index. Positive values indicate that inequality is driven by early adoption by the wealthy (top inequality), whereas negative values signal bottom inequality. Results. Absolute inequalities were widest when national coverage was around 50%. At low national coverage levels, top inequality was evident with coverage in the wealthiest quintile taking off rapidly; at 60% or higher national coverage, bottom inequality became the predominant pattern, with the poorest quintile lagging behind. Conclusions. Policies need to be tailored to inequality patterns. When top inequalities are present, barriers that limit uptake by most of the population must be identified and addressed. When bottom inequalities exist, interventions must be targeted at specific subgroups that are left behind. © 2018 American Public Health Association Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Objectives. To describe a community-wide contraception initiative and assess changes in method use when cost and access barriers are removed in an environment with client-centered counseling. Methods. HER Salt Lake is a prospective cohort study occurring during three 6-month periods (September 2015 through March 2017) and nested in a quasiexperimental observational study. The sample was women aged 16 to 45 years receiving new contraceptive services at health centers in Salt Lake County, Utah. Following the control period, intervention 1 removed cost and ensured staffing and pharmacy stocking; intervention 2 introduced targeted electronic outreach. We used logistic regression and interrupted time series regression analyses to assess impact. Results. New contraceptive services were provided to 4107 clients in the control period, 3995 in intervention 1, and 3407 in intervention 2. The odds of getting an intrauterine device or implant increased 1.6 times (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5, 1.6) during intervention 1 and 2.5 times (95% CI = 2.2, 2.8) during intervention 2, relative to the control period. Time series analysis demonstrated that participating health centers placed an additional 59 intrauterine devices and implants on average per month (95% CI = 13, 105) after intervention 1. Conclusions. Removing client cost and increasing clinic capacity was associated with shifts in contraceptive method mix in an environment with client-centered counseling; targeted electronic outreach further augmented these results. © 2018 American Public Health Association Inc.

Abstract: Objectives. To document, via linked administrative data, the cumulative prevalence among New Zealand children of notifications to child protective services (CPS), substantiated maltreatment cases, and out-of-home placements. Methods. We followed all children born in New Zealand in 1998 until the end of 2015 (an overall sample of 55 443 children). We determined the cumulative frequencies of notifications, substantiated maltreatment cases (by subtype), and first entries into foster care from birth through the age of 17 years. We also decomposed CPS involvement by gender. Results. We found that almost 1 in 4 children had been subject to at least 1 report to CPS at age 17 years (23.5%), and 9.7% had been a victim of substantiated abuse or neglect. We also found that 3.1% had experienced out-of-home placements by age 17 years, with boys being more affected. Conclusions. Both notifications and substantiated child maltreatment are more common in New Zealand than is generally recognized, with the incidence of notifications higher than the incidence of medicated asthma among children and the prevalence of substantiations similar to the prevalence of obesity. © 2018 American Public Health Association Inc.

Abstract: Anti-immigrant rhetoric and political actions gained prominence andpublicsupportbefore,during, and after the 2016 presidential election. This anti-immigrant political environment threatens to increase health disparities among undocumented persons, immigrant groups, and people of color. I discuss the mechanisms by which anti-immigrant stigma exacerbates racial/ethnic health disparities through increasing multilevel discrimination and stress, deportation and detention, and policies that limit health resources. I argue that the anti-immigrant sociopolitical context is a social determinant of health that affects mostly communities of color, both immigrants and nonimmigrants. Public health has a moral obligation to consider how immigration policy is health policy and to be prepared to respond to worsening health disparities as a result of anti-immigrant racism. © 2018 American Public Health Association Inc.

Abstract: Objectives. To quantify nationwide disparities in the location of particulate matter (PM)-emitting facilities by the characteristics of the surrounding residential population and to illustrate various spatial scales at which to consider such disparities. Methods. We assigned facilities emitting PM in the 2011 National Emissions Inventory to nearby block groups across the 2009 to 2013 American Community Survey population. We calculated the burden from these emissions for racial/ethnic groups and by poverty status. We quantified disparities nationally and for each state and county in the country. Results. For PM of 2.5 micrometers in diameter or less, those in poverty had 1.35 times higher burden than did the overall population, and non-Whites had 1.28 times higher burden. Blacks, specifically, had 1.54 times higher burden than did the overall population. These patterns were relatively unaffected by sensitivity analyses, and disparities held not only nationally but within most states and counties as well. Conclusions. Disparities in burden from PM-emitting facilities exist at multiple geographic scales. Disparities for Blacks are more pronounced than are disparities on the basis of poverty status. Strictly socioeconomic considerations may be insufficient to reduce PM burdens equitably across populations. © 2018 American Public Health Association Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Objectives. To evaluate whether a public program providing long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods free of charge increases the LARC initiation rate and reduces the unintended pregnancy rate in the general population. Methods. Since 2013, all women in Vantaa, Finland, have been entitled to 1 LARC method free of charge. With time-series analysis between 2000 and 2015, we assessed whether this public program was associated with changes in steady-state mean rates of LARC initiation and abortions. Results. The initiation rate of LARCs (1/1000 women) increased 2.2-fold from 1.9 to 4.2 after the intervention (P < .001). Concomitantly, the abortion rate (1/1000 women) declined by 16% from 1.1 to 0.9 in the total sample (P < .001), by 36% from 1.3 to 0.8 among those aged 15 to 19 years (P < .001), and by 14% from 2.0 to 1.7 among those aged 20 to 24 years (P = .01). Conclusions. The LARC program was associated with increased uptake of LARC methods and fewer abortions in the population. Public Health Implications. Entitling the population to LARC methods free of charge is an effective means to reduce the unmet need of contraception and the need for abortion, especially among women younger than 25 years. © 2018 American Public Health Association Inc.

Abstract: Background. Deficiencies in older people’s social relationships (including loneliness, social isolation, and low social support) have been implicated as a cause of premature mortality and increased morbidity. Whether they affect service use is unclear. Objectives. To determine whether social relationships are associated with older adults’ use of health services, independently of health-related needs. Search Methods. We searched 8 electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination) for data published between 1983 and 2016. We also identified relevant sources from scanning the reference lists of included studies and review articles, contacting authors to identify additional studies, and searching the tables of contents of key journals. Selection Criteria. Studies met inclusion criteria if more than 50% of participants were older than 60 years or mean age was older than 60 years; they included a measure of social networks, received social support, or perceived support; and they reported quantitative data on the association between social relationships and older adults’ health service utilization. Data Collection and Analysis. Two researchers independently screened studies for inclusion. They extracted data and appraised study quality by using standardized forms. In a narrative synthesis, we grouped the studies according to the outcome of interest (physician visits, hospital admissions, hospital readmissions, emergency department use, hospital length of stay, utilization of home- and community-based services, contact with general health services, and mental health service use) and the domain of social relationships covered (social networks, received social support, or perceived support). For each service type and social relationship domain, we assessed the strength of the evidence across studies according to the quantity and quality of studies and consistency of findings. Main Results. The literature search retrieved 26 077 citations, 126 of which met inclusion criteria. Data were reported across 226 678 participants from 19 countries. We identified strong evidence of an association between weaker social relationships and increased rates of readmission to hospital (75% of high-quality studies reported evidence of an association in the same direction). In evidence of moderate strength, according to 2 high-quality and 3 medium-quality studies, smaller social networks were associated with longer hospital stays. When we considered received and perceived social support separately, they were not linked to health care use. Overall, the evidence did not indicate that older patients with weaker social relationships place greater demands on ambulatory care (including physician visits and community- or home-based services) than warranted by their needs. Authors’ Conclusions. Current evidence does not support the view that, independently of health status, older patients with lower levels of social support place greater demands on ambulatory care. Future research on social relationships would benefit from a consensus on clinically relevant concepts to measure. Public Health Implications. Our findings are important for public health because they challenge the notion that lonely older adults are a burden on all health and social care services. In high-income countries, interventions aimed at reducing social isolation and loneliness are promoted as a means of preventing inappropriate service use. Our review cautions against assuming that reductions in care utilization can be achieved by intervening to strengthen social relationships. © 2018 American Public Health Association Inc.

Abstract: Objectives. To examine trends in the percentage of US secondary schools that implemented practices related to the support of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) students. Methods. This analysis used data from 4 cycles (2008–2014) of School Health Profiles, a surveillance system that provides results representative of secondary schools in each state. Each school completed 2 self-administered questionnaires (principal and teacher) per cycle. We used logistic regression models to examine linear trends. Results. Of 8 examined practices to support LGBTQ youths, only 1—identifying safe spaces for LGBTQ youths—increased in most states (72%) from 2010 to 2014. Among the remaining 7, only 1—prohibiting harassment based on a student’s perceived or actual sexual orientation or gender identity—had relatively high rates of adoption (a median of 90.3% of schools in 2014) across states. Conclusions. Many states have seen no change in the implementation of school practices associated with LGBTQ students’ health and well-being. © 2018 American Public Health Association Inc.

Abstract: Clinical independence is an essential component of good health care and health care professionalism, particularly in correctional settings (jails, prisons, and other places of detention), where the relationship between patients and caregivers is not based on free choice and where the punitive correctional setting can challenge optimal medical care. Independence for the delivery of health care services is defined by international standards as a critical element for quality health care in correctional settings, yet many correctional facilities do not meet these standards because of a lack of awareness, persisting legal regulations, contradictory terms of employment for health professionals, or current health care governance structures. We present recommendations for the implementation of independent health care in correctional settings. © 2018 American Public Health Association Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Objectives. To examine gun storage practices and factors influencing those practices among gun owners. Methods. We conducted a nationally representative online survey of US gun owners (n = 1444) in 2016 to assess gun storage practices and attitudes, factors influencing storage practices, and groups that might effectively communicate regarding safe storage. We generated descriptive statistics by using cross-tabulations and used logistic regression to estimate characteristics that influenced safe storage practices. Results. Forty-six percent of gun owners reported safely storing all of their guns. Factors associated with higher odds of reporting safe storage were having a child in the home (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03, 2.03), only owning handguns (AOR = 1.84; 95% CI = 1.24, 2.73), and reporting that storage decisions were influenced by a gun safety course (AOR = 2.05; 95% CI = 1.54, 2.74) or discussions with family members (AOR = 1.39; 95% CI = 1.05, 1.86). Gun owners ranked law enforcement, hunting or outdoors groups, active-duty military, and the National Rifle Association as most effective in communicating safe storage practices. Conclusions. Public health campaigns to promote safe gun storage should consider partnering with groups that garner respect among gun owners for their experience with safe use of guns. © 2018 American Public Health Association Inc.

Abstract: Objectives. To examine how combinations of state policies, rather than single policies, are related to uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. Methods. Using publicly available records and the literature, we characterized policies for each US state and Washington, DC, in 2015 (n = 51), including (1) Medicaid expansion, (2) policies permitting HPV vaccination in pharmacies, (3) school-entry requirements, (4) classroom sex education mandates, and (5) parental education mandates. Using qualitative comparative analysis, we identified which existing combinations of these policies were necessary and sufficient for high HPV vaccine initiation among adolescents, with National Immunization Survey-Teen data. Results. No single policy was necessary or sufficient for high HPV vaccine uptake; however, 1 set of policies had consistently high HPV vaccine uptake: adoption of all policies except parental education mandates (girls: consistency = 1.00, coverage = 0.07; boys: consistency = 0.99, coverage = 0.08). Conclusions. We identified a set of polices related to high HPV vaccine uptake. Future studies should examine how these policies and others, individually and in combination, are associated with HPV vaccine uptake. Public Health Implications. This study provides insight into what sets of policies are consistently related to high HPV vaccine uptake. © 2018 American Public Health Association Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Objectives. To explore the effect of Medicaid expansion on US infant mortality rate. Methods. We examined data from 2010 to 2016 and 2014 to 2016 to compare infant mortality rates in states and Washington, DC, that accepted the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion (Medicaid expansion states) and states that did not (non–Medicaid expansion states), stratifying data by race/ethnicity. Results. Mean infant mortality rate in non–Medicaid expansion states rose (6.4 to 6.5) from 2014 to 2016 but declined in Medicaid expansion states (5.9 to 5.6). Mean difference in infant mortality rate in Medicaid expansion versus non–Medicaid expansion states increased from 0.573 (P = .08) in 2014 to 0.838 in 2016 (P = .006) because of smaller declines in non–Medicaid expansion (11.0%) than in Medicaid expansion (15.2%) states. The 14.5% infant mortality rate decline from 11.7 to 10.0 in African American infants in Medicaid expansion states was more than twice that in non–Medicaid expansion states (6.6%: 12.2 to 11.4; P = .012). Conclusions. Infant mortality rate decline was greater in Medicaid expansion states, with greater declines among African American infants. Future research should explore what aspects of Medicaid expansion may improve infant survival. © 2018 American Public Health Association Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Objectives. To compare the prevalence and characteristics of facility laws governing abortion provision specifically (targeted regulation of abortion providers [TRAP] laws); office-based surgeries, procedures, sedation or anesthesia (office interventions) generally (OBS laws); and other procedures specifically. Methods. We conducted cross-sectional legal assessments of state facility laws for office interventions in effect as of August 1, 2016. We coded characteristics for each law and compared characteristics across categories of laws. Results. TRAP laws (n = 55; in 34 states) were more prevalent than OBS laws (n = 25; in 25 states) or laws targeting other procedures (n = 1; in 1 state). TRAP laws often regulated facilities that would not be regulated under OBS laws (e.g., all TRAP laws, but only 2 OBS laws, applied regardless of sedation or anesthesia used). TRAP laws imposed more numerous and more stringent requirements than OBS laws. Conclusions. Many states regulate abortion-providing facilities differently, and more stringently, than facilities providing other office interventions. The Supreme Court’s 2016 decision in Whole Woman’s Health v Hellerstedt casts doubt on the legitimacy of that differential treatment. © 2018 American Public Health Association Inc.

Abstract: Objectives. To investigate local-level adult influenza and pneumococcal vaccination disparities to inform targeted interventions. Methods. Questions on influenza and pneumococcal vaccination uptake were included in a door-to-door community-based representative survey conducted in 10 Chicago, Illinois, neighborhoods in 2015 and 2016. A total of 1543 adults completed the survey, including 172 adults aged 65 years or older. We calculated adult influenza (‡ 18 years) and pneumococcal (‡ 65 years) vaccination coverage by community area and respondent characteristics. Results. We observed significant differences in pneumococcal vaccination coverage between community areas (range = 18%–91%). Influenza vaccination coverage differed by gender, age, insurance coverage, acculturation, and confidence or trust in physician. Non-Hispanic Blacks were more likely to be vaccinated when they had higher confidence or trust in their physician (45% vs 20%; P < .01). Mexicans who reported less acculturation were more likely to be vaccinated than were Mexicans who were more acculturated (41% vs 27%; P = .02). Conclusions. Striking disparities between neighborhoods and racial/ethnic groups in adult influenza and pneumococcal vaccination coverage highlight the need for improved local-level immunization coverage data. © 2018 American Public Health Association Inc.

Abstract: Objectives. To estimate birth reduction potentially in response to Zika virus–associated microcephaly among the 36 largest Brazilian cities. Methods. We analyzed the number of live births per month on the basis of information on approximately 8.2 million births from all of Brazil’s state capitals and cities that had more than 10 000 annual births. Results. In the second half of 2016, the live birth rate was reduced by 7.78% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.64%, 8.89%; P < .001). This reduction was correlated with the Zika virus–associated microcephaly rate. In the cities with the highest microcephaly rate in 2015 (> 1 case per 1000 live births), the reduction in the live birth rate was 10.84% (95% CI = 8.58%, 13.04%). Conclusions. The birth rate in the largest Brazilian cities during the second half of 2016 was significantly reduced, which is potentially the effect of a birth control recommendation prompted by an epidemiological alert. Public Health Implications. The effects of population-based interventions should be weighed by considering the actual risk of disease and the sociodemographic impact of strategies such as birth control. © 2018 American Public Health Association Inc.

Abstract: Objectives. To describe the adaptive behaviors in a large sample of homeless children and identify factors associated with developmental delay. Methods. Data were from a cross-sectional survey of 557 children younger than 6 years randomly sampled among homeless sheltered families in the Paris region, France (January–May 2013). An interviewer and a psychologist conducted face-to-face interviews to collect information on sociodemographic and health characteristics. We assessed adaptive behaviors using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, second edition (VABS-II). Results. The mean VABS-II composite score (SD) was 75.4 (12.0), and most participating children (80.9%) were considered developmentally delayed. Characteristics negatively associated with children’s developmental score were age, birth in a country other than France, low birth weight, and past-year hospitalization. Conclusions. There is a high prevalence of developmental delays among children growing up homeless. Public Health Implications. Long-term integrated programs improving parenting and children’s opportunities for stimulation and socialization should be developed in daycare centers, schools, shelters, and medical practices to minimize negative effects of early living conditions on children’s development. © 2018 American Public Health Association Inc.

Abstract: Objectives. To examine the impact of the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA’s) 2010 parental insurance coverage extension to young adults aged 19 to 25 years on health insurance coverage and access to care, including racial/ethnic disparities. Methods. We pooled data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System for the periods 2007 to 2009 and 2011 to 2013 (n = 402 777). We constructed quasiexperimental difference-in-differences models in which adults aged 26 to 35 years served as a control group. Multivariable statistical models controlled for covariates guided by the Andersen model for health care utilization. Results. On average, insurance rates among young adults increased 6.12 percentage points after ACA implementation (P < .001). All racial/ethnic groups experienced increases in coverage. However, the impact varied by race/ethnicity and was largest for Whites. Young adults had a 2.61 percentage point (P < .001) decrease in experiencing barriers to health care because of cost issues after the ACA, with variation by race/ ethnicity. Conclusions. The ACA’s expansion had a significant positive effect for young adults acquiring health insurance and reducing cost-related barriers to accessing health care. However, racial/ethnic disparities in coverage and access persist. Public Health Implications. Policies not dependent on parental insurance could further increase access and reduce disparities. © 2018 American Public Health Association Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Objectives. To examine the effect of Florida’s adoption of Statute 335.065—a law requiring the routine accommodation of nonmotorized road users (i.e., a “Complete Streets” policy)—on pedestrian fatalities and to identify factors influencing its implementation. Methods. We used a multimethod design (interrupted time-series quasi-experiment and interviews) to calculate Florida’s pedestrian fatality rates from 1975 to 2013—39 quarters before and 117 quarters after adoption of the law. Using statistical models, we compared Florida with regional and national comparison groups. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 current and former Florida transportation professionals in 2015. Results. Florida’s pedestrian fatality rates decreased significantly—by at least 0.500% more each quarter—after Statute 335.065 was adopted, resulting in more than 3500 lives saved across 29 years. Interviewees described supports and challenges associated with implementing the law. Conclusions. Florida Statute 335.065 is associated with a 3-decade decrease in pedestrian fatalities. The study also reveals factors that influenced the implementation and effectiveness of the law. Public Health Implications. Transportation policies—particularly Complete Streets policies—can have significant, quantifiable impacts on population health. Multimethod designs are valuable approaches to policy evaluations. © 2018 American Public Health Association Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The UN Sustainable Development Goals of 2015 have restored universal health coverage (UHC) to prominence in the international health agenda. Can understanding the past illuminate the prospects for UHC in the present? This article traces an earlier history of UHC as an objective of international health politics. Its focus is the efforts of the International Labor Organization (ILO), whose Philadelphia Declaration (1944) announced the goal of universal social security, including medical coverage and care. After World War II, the ILO attempted to enshrine this in an international convention, which nation states would ratify. However, by 1952 these efforts had failed, and the final convention was so diluted that universalism was unobtainable. Our analysis first explains the consolidation of ideas about social security and health care, tracing transnational policy linkages among experts whose world view transcended narrow loyalties. We then show how UHC goals became marginalized, through the opposition of employers and organized medicine, and of certain nation states, both rich and poor. We conclude with reflections on how these findings might help us in thinking about the challenges of advancing UHC today.

Abstract: Objectives. To determine the socioeconomic consequences of receipt versus denial of abortion. Methods. Women who presented for abortion just before or after the gestational age limit of 30 abortion facilities across the United States between 2008 and 2010 were recruited and followed for 5 years via semiannual telephone interviews. Using mixed effects models, we evaluated socioeconomic outcomes for 813 women by receipt or denial of abortion care. Results. In analyses that adjusted for the few baseline differences, women denied abortions who gave birth had higher odds of poverty 6 months after denial (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.77; P < .001) than did women who received abortions; women denied abortions were also more likely to be in poverty for 4 years after denial of abortion. Six months after denial of abortion, women were less likely to be employed full time (AOR = 0.37; P = .001) and were more likely to receive public assistance (AOR = 6.26; P < .001) than were women who obtained abortions, differences that remained significant for 4 years. Conclusions. Women denied an abortion were more likely than were women who received an abortion to experience economic hardship and insecurity lasting years. Laws that restrict access to abortion may result in worsened economic outcomes for women.

Abstract: Background. Continued racial/ethnic health disparities were recently described as “the most serious and shameful health care issue of our time.” Although the 2014 US Affordable Care Act-mandated national insurance coverage expansion has led to significant improvements in health care coverage and access, its effects on life expectancy are not yet known. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the largest US integrated health care system, has a sustained commitment to health equity that addresses all 3 stages of health disparities research: detection, understanding determinants, and reduction or elimination. Despite this, racial disparities still exist in the VHA across a wide range of clinical areas and service types. Objectives. To inform the health equity research agenda, we synthesized evidence on racial/ethnic mortality disparities in the VHA. Search Methods. Our research librarian searched MEDLINE and Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials from October 2006 through February 2017 using terms for racial groups and disparities. Selection Criteria. We included studies if they compared mortality between any racial/ethnic minority and nonminority veteran groups or between different minority groups in the VHA (PROSPERO# CRD42015015974). We made study selection decisions on the basis of prespecified eligibility criteria. They were first made by 1 reviewer and checked by a second and disagreements were resolved by consensus (sequential review). Data Collection and Analysis. Two reviewers sequentially abstracted data on prespecified population, outcome, setting, and study design characteristics. Two reviewers sequentially graded the strength of evidence using prespecified criteria on the basis of 5 key domains: study limitations (study design and internal validity), consistency, directness, precision of the evidence, and reporting biases. We synthesized the evidence qualitatively by grouping studies first by racial/ethnic minority group and then by clinical area. For areas with multiple studies in the same population and outcome, we pooled their reported hazard ratios (HRs) using random effects models (StatsDirect version 2.8.0; StatsDirect Ltd., Altrincham, England). We created an evidence map using a bubble plot format to represent the evidence base in 5 dimensions: odds ratio or HR of mortality for racial/ethnic minority group versus Whites, clinical area, strength of evidence, statistical significance, and racial group. Main Results. From 2840 citations, we included 25 studies. Studies were large (n ‡ 10 000) and involved nationally representative cohorts, and the majority were of fair quality. Most studies compared mortality between Black and White veterans and found similar or lower mortality for Black veterans. However, we found modest mortality disparities (HR or OR = 1.07, 1.52) for Black veterans with stage 4 chronic kidney disease, colon cancer, diabetes, HIV, rectal cancer, or stroke; for American Indian and Alaska Native veterans undergoing noncardiac major surgery; and for Hispanic veterans with HIV or traumatic brain injury (most low strength). Author’s Conclusions. Although the VHA’s equal access health care system has reduced many racial/ethnic mortality disparities present in the private sector, our review identified mortality disparities that have persisted mainly for Black veterans in several clinical areas. However, because most mortality disparities were supported by single studies with imprecise findings, we could not draw strong conclusions about this evidence. More disparities research is needed for American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, and Hispanic veterans overall and for more of the largest life expectancy gaps. Public Health Implications. Because of the relatively high prevalence of diabetes in Black veterans, further research to better understand and reduce this mortality disparity may be prioritized as having the greatest potential impact. However, other mortality disparities affect thousands of veterans and cannot be ignored.

Abstract: Epidemiology instruction has expanded at the undergraduate level in part because it increases student critical thinking and scientific literacy, promotes students’ perception of public health as both practical and relevant, and empowers students as independent, lifelong learners. Why then are more high schools not adopting epidemiology as a course requirement for students? Although prior iterations of high school epidemiology courses are noteworthy for incorporating active and participatory learning, embedding them into existing and continually shifting curricula is challenging and time-consuming, especially for teachers not trained in the field. It also may be argued that currently available epidemiology teaching resources emphasize content rather than thinking skills and therefore do not optimally promote students’ personal engagement with, and in-depth understanding of, the mission and goals of public health. I propose a new framework for high school epidemiology that draws from progressive education ideology, including three critical elements: empowerment, authenticity, and transfer. I provide multiple examples to show how this framework has been used across a wide array of settings to hone epidemiology thinking skills in high school students.

Abstract: Objectives. To examine trends and socioeconomic disparities for preventable dental-related emergency department (ED) visits in Nevada. Methods. We pooled retrospective data containing 66 267 ED visits involving dental conditions from Nevada hospital ED databases from 2009 to 2015. The dependent variable was nontraumatic dental conditions identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes; 3 independent variables included treatment year, health insurance status, and race/ethnicity. Results. Odds of ED visits for nontraumatic dental conditions increased 16% annually from 2009 to 2015 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13, 1.19). Medicaid (OR = 2.16; 95% CI = 1.96, 2.39) and uninsured patients (OR = 2.75; 95% CI = 2.52, 3.00) presenting with nontraumatic dental conditions were 1 to 2 times more likely than those with private dental insurance to seek ED treatment. Black patients were more likely than White patients to seek ED treatment (OR = 1.13; 95% CI = 1.02, 1.24). Conclusions. Socioeconomic and demographic factors were significantly associated with ED visits for nontraumatic dental conditions, with a steady increase in trends and a widening of socioeconomic disparities in recent years.

Abstract: Objectives. To compare the effectiveness of patient navigation-enhanced case management in supporting engagement in HIV care upon release from jail relative to existing services. Methods. We randomized 270 HIV-infected individuals to receive navigation-enhanced case management for 12 months or standard case management for 90 days following release from jail between 2010 and 2013. Participants were interviewed at 2, 6, and 12 months after release. We abstracted medical data from jail and city health records. Results. Patient navigation-enhanced case management resulted in greater linkage to care within 30 days of release (odds ratio [OR] = 2.15; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23, 3.75) and consistent retention over 12 months (OR = 1.95; 95% CI = 1.11, 3.46). Receipt of treatment for substance use disorders in jail also resulted in early linkage (OR = 4.06; 95% CI = 1.93, 8.53) and retention (OR = 2.52; 95% CI = 1.21, 5.23). Latinos were less likely to be linked to (OR = 0.35; 95% CI = 0.14, 0.91) or retained in (OR = 0.28; 95% CI = 0.09, 0.82) HIV care. Conclusions. Patient navigation supports maintaining engagement in care and can mitigate health disparities, and should become the standard of care for HIV-infected individuals leaving jail.

Abstract: Objectives. To describe long-term national trends in health insurance coverage among US veterans from 2000 to 2016 in the context of recent health care reform. Methods. We used 2000 to 2016 National Health Interview Survey data on veterans aged 18 to 64 years to examine trends in insurance coverage and uninsurance by year, income, and state Medicaid expansion status. We also explored the current proportions of veterans with each type of insurance by age group. Results. The percentage of veterans with private insurance decreased from 70.8% in 2000 to 56.9% in 2011, whereas between 2000 and 2016 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care coverage (only) almost tripled, Medicaid (without concurrent TRICARE or private coverage) doubled, and TRICARE coverage of any type tripled. After 2011, the percentage of veterans who were uninsured decreased. In 2016, low-income veterans in Medicaid expansion states had double the Medicaid coverage (41.1%) of low-income veterans in nonexpansion states (20.1%). Conclusions. Our estimates, which are nationally representative of noninstitutionalized veterans, show marked increases in military-related coverage through TRICARE and VA health care. In 2016, only 7.2% of veterans aged 18 to 64 years and 3.7% of all veterans (aged 18 years or older) remained uninsured.

Abstract: In global disease outbreaks, there are significant time delays between the source of an outbreak and collective action. Some delay is necessary, but recent delays have been extended by insufficient surveillance capacity and time-consuming efforts to mobilize action. Three public health emergencies of international concern (PHEICs)-H1N1, Ebola, and Zika-allow us to identify and compare sources of delays and consider seven hypotheses about what influences the length of delays. These hypotheses can then motivate further research that empirically tests them. The three PHEICs suggest that deferred global mobilization is a greater source of delay than is poor surveillance capacity. These case study outbreaks support hypotheses that we see quicker responses for novel diseases when outbreaks do not coincide with holidays and when US citizens are infected. They do not support hypotheses that we see quicker responses for more severe outbreaks or those that threaten larger numbers of people. Better understanding the reason for delays can help target policy interventions and identify the kind of global institutional changes needed to reduce the spread and severity of future PHEICs.

Abstract: Objectives. To estimate potential impacts of California Assembly Bill (AB) 1316: a requirement for universal screening and insurance coverage for child blood lead testing. Methods. In April 2017 the California Health Benefits Review Program (Oakland, CA) analyzed AB 1316 for the California legislature, including a systematic review of lead screening effectiveness, commercial insurer surveys regarding screening coverage, and actuarial utilization and cost implication assessments. Results. Universal screening requirements would increase child lead testing by 273%, raise affected populations’ premiums by 0.0043%, and detect an additional 4777 exposed children 1 year after implementation. Conclusions. The evidence for a net societal benefit of universal screening approach is limited and is not supported by prominent medical professional groups. Public Health Implications. California expanded targeted screening to identify additional children at higher risk for lead poisoning on the basis of California-specific risk factors, while mitigating the potential harms of universal screening such as an increase in false positive tests and health care costs.

Abstract: Objectives. To examine health benefits and cost-effectiveness of implementing a freeway deck park to increase urban green space. Methods. Using the Cross-Bronx Expressway in New York City as a case study, we explored the cost-effectiveness of implementing deck parks. We built a microsimulation model that included increased exercise, fewer accidents, and less pollution as well as the cost of implementation and maintenance of the park. We estimated both the quality-adjusted life years gained and the societal costs for 2017. Results. Implementation of a deck park over sunken parts of Cross-Bronx Expressway appeared to save both lives and money. Savings were realized for 84% of Monte Carlo simulations. Conclusions. In a rapidly urbanizing world, reclaiming green space through deck parks can bring health benefits alongside economic savings over the long term. Public Health Implications. Policymakers are seeking ways to create cross-sectorial synergies that might improve both quality of urban life and health. However, such projects are very expensive, and there is little information on their return of investment. Our analysis showed that deck parks produce exceptional value when implemented over below-grade sections of road.

Abstract: Objectives. To estimate the impact of hypothetical antimalarial and nutritional interventions (which reduce the prevalence of low midupper arm circumference [MUAC]) on the incidence of low birth weight (LBW). Methods. We analyzed data from 14 633 pregnancies from 13 studies conducted across Africa and the Western Pacific from 1996 to 2015. We calculated population intervention effects for increasing intermittent preventive therapy in pregnancy (IPTp), full coverage with bed nets, reduction in malaria infection at delivery, and reductions in the prevalence of low MUAC. Results. We estimated that, compared with observed IPTp use, administering 3 or more doses of IPTp to all women would decrease the incidence of LBW from 9.9% to 6.9% (risk difference = 3.0%; 95% confidence interval = 1.7%, 4.0%). The intervention effects for eliminating malaria at delivery, increasing bed net ownership, and decreasing low MUAC prevalence were all modest. Conclusions. Increasing IPTp uptake to at least 3 doses could decrease the incidence of LBW in malaria-endemic countries. The impact of IPTp on LBW was greater than the effect of prevention of malaria, consistent with a nonmalarial effect of IPTp, measurement error, or selection bias.

Abstract: Social media (SM) offer huge potential for public health research, serving as a vehicle for surveillance, delivery of health interventions, recruitment to trials, collection of data, and dissemination. However, the networked nature of the data means they are riddled with ethical challenges, and no clear consensus has emerged as to the ethical handling of such data. This article outlines the key ethical concerns for public health researchers using SM and discusses how these concerns might best be addressed. Key issues discussed include privacy; anonymity and confidentiality; authenticity; the rapidly changing SM environment; informed consent; recruitment, voluntary participation, and sampling; minimizing harm; and data security and management. Despite the obvious need, producing a set of prescriptive guidelines for researchers using SM is difficult because the field is evolving quickly. What is clear, however, is that the ethical issues connected to SM-related public health research are also growing. Most importantly, public health researchers must work within the ethical principles set out by the Declaration of Helsinki that protect individual users first and foremost.

Abstract: Objectives. To assess the effect of households’ outlays for medical expenditures on income inequality and changes since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Methods. We analyzed data from the US Current Population Surveys for calendar years 2010 through 2014. We calculated the Gini index of income inequality before and after subtracting households’ medical outlays (including insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs) from income, the financial burden of medical outlays for each income decile, and the number of individuals pushed below poverty by medical outlays. Results. In 2014, the Gini index was 47.84, which rose to 49.21 after medical outlays were subtracted, indicating that medical outlays effectively redistributed about 1.37% of total income from poorer to richer individuals, a slightly smaller redistribution compared with the years before the ACA. Medical outlays reduced the median income of the poorest decile by 47.6% versus 2.7% for the wealthiest decile and pushed 7.013 million individuals into poverty. Conclusions. The way we finance medical care exacerbates income inequality and impoverishes millions of Americans. This regressive financing pattern improved minimally in the wake of the ACA.

Abstract: The Appalachian Region has among the highest rates of smoking and smoking-related illness in the United States. Strong smoke-free legislation could help protect nonsmoking residents from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. However, there is a dearth of state, county, city, and subcounty smoke-free law coverage throughout Appalachia. As of July 2016, only 21% of Appalachian residents were covered by comprehensive smoke-free laws (i.e., 100% coverage for workplaces, restaurants, and bars). Only 46% of Appalachians lived in places with 100% smoke-free workplace laws, only 30% lived in places with 100% smoke-free restaurant laws, and only 29% lived in places with 100% smoke-free bar laws. Reasons for this lack of smoke-free law coverage include socioeconomic disadvantage, the historical importance of tobacco in Appalachian economies, and preemptive state legislation. By understanding the contextual issues that have inhibited smoke-free legislation, smokefree advocates will be better prepared to lead efforts that expand smoke-free coverage in this region.

Abstract: Despite its inclusion in models of social and ecological determinants of health, work has not been explored in most health inequity research in the United States. Leaving work out of public health inequities research creates a blind spot in our understanding of how inequities are created and impedes our progress toward health equity. We first describe why work is vital to our understanding of observed societal-level health inequities. Next, we outline challenges to incorporating work in the study of health inequities, including (1) the complexity of work as a concept; (2) work’s overlap with socioeconomic position, race, ethnicity, and gender; (3) the development of a parallel line of inquiry into occupational health inequities; and (4) the dearth of precise data with which to explore the relationships between work and health status. Finally, we summarize opportunities for advancing health equity and monitoring progress that could be achieved if researchers and practitioners more robustly include work in their efforts to understand and address health inequities.

Abstract: Objectives. To examine indoor sex workers’ strategies in preventing workplace violence and influential socio-structural conditions. Methods. Data included qualitative interviews with 85 sex workers in British Columbia, Canada, from 2014 through 2016. For analyses, we used interpretive thematic techniques informed by World Health Organization position statements on violence. Results. Robbery, nonpayment, financial exploitation, and privacy violations were frequent types of violence perpetrated by clients, landlords, and neighbors. We identified 2 themes that depicted how sex workers prevented violence and mitigated its effects: (1) navigating physical spaces and (2) navigating client relationships. Conclusions. Sex workers’ diverse strategies to prevent violence and mitigate its effects are creative and effective in many circumstances. These are limited, however, by the absence of legal and public health regulations governing occupational health and safety and stigma associated with sex work. Public Health Implications. Occupational health and safety regulatory policies that set conditions for clients’ substance and condom use within commercial sex transactions are required. Revisions to the current legal regulations governing prostitution are critical to support optimal work environments that reduce the likelihood of violence. These revisions must recognize sex work as a form of labor versus victimization.

Abstract: Objectives. To estimate the proportions of illicit cigarette consumption in Brazil from 2012 to 2016, a period of sharp increases in cigarette taxes. Methods. We used an approach based on legal sales provided by the Secretariat of Federal Revenues and self-reported consumption data from an annually conducted telephone survey (VIGITEL) to estimate the changes over time in illegal cigarette use in Brazil. For that purpose, we also used available information on the proportion of illegal cigarette consumption from a nationwide household survey conducted in 2013 to calculate a constant proportion of underreporting from VIGITEL in relation to total consumption and sales in Brazil. Results. There was an increase in the estimated proportion of illicit cigarette use from 2012 to 2013 (from 28.6% to 32.3%), then a decrease from 2013 to 2014 (32.3% to 28.8%), and then a sustained trend of increase from 2014 to 2016 (28.8% to 42.8%). Conclusions. Novel and feasible approaches to estimate changes over time in the illegal market are important for helping the effective implementation of tobacco excise tax policy.

Abstract: Objectives. To estimate the prevalence and consequences of receiving prescription opioids from both the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Medicare Part D. Methods. Among US veterans enrolled in both VA and Part D filling 1 or more opioid prescriptions in 2012 (n = 539 473), we calculated 3 opioid safety measures using morphine milligram equivalents (MME): (1) proportion receiving greater than 100 MME for 1 or more days, (2) mean days receiving greater than 100 MME, and (3) proportion receiving greater than 120 MME for 90 consecutive days. We compared these measures by opioid source. Results. Overall, 135 643 (25.1%) veterans received opioids from VA only, 332 630 (61.7%) from Part D only, and 71 200 (13.2%) from both. The dual-use group was more likely than the VA-only group to receive greater than 100 MME for 1 or more days (34.3% vs 10.9%; adjusted risk ratio [ARR] = 3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.9, 3.1), have more days with greater than 100 MME (42.5 vs 16.9 days; adjusted difference = 16.4 days; 95% CI = 15.7, 17.2), and to receive greater than 120 MME for 90 consecutive days (7.8% vs 3.1%; ARR = 2.2; 95% CI = 2.1, 2.3). Conclusions. Among veterans dually enrolled in VA and Medicare Part D, dual use of opioids was associated with more than 2 to 3 times the risk of high-dose opioid exposure.

Abstract: Objectives. To explore the programmatic reach and experience of high-need adolescents who received sexual health education in 3 distinct implementation settings (targeted-prevention settings, traditional schools, and alternative schools) through a statewide sexual health education program. Methods. Data are from youth surveys collected between September 2013 and December 2014 in the California Personal Responsibility Education Program. A sample of high-need participants (n = 747) provided data to examine the impact of implementation setting on reach and program experience. Results. Implementation in targeted-prevention settings was equal to or more effective at providing a positive program experience for high-need participants. More than 5 times as many high-need participants were served in targeted-prevention settings compared with traditional schools. Reaching the same number of high-need participants served in targeted-prevention settings over 15 months would take nearly 7 years of programming in traditional schools. Conclusions. To maximize the reach and experience of high-need youth populations receiving sexual health education, state and local agencies should consider the importance of implementation setting. Targeted resources and efforts should be directed toward high-need young people by expanding beyond traditional school settings.

Abstract: Objectives. To estimate the impact of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participation on cost-related medication nonadherence (CRN) for older adults in the United States, with a particular focus on those who are food insecure and those threatened by hunger. Methods. We used propensity score matching to create matched intervention and comparison groups of SNAP-eligible US adults aged 60 years and older with data from the 2013–2015 National Health Interview Survey. Intervention group participants were identified on the basis of self-reported SNAP participation in the past year. Results. SNAP participants were 4.8 percentage points less likely to engage in CRN than eligible nonparticipants (P < .01). The effect of SNAP is about twice as large for older adults threatened by hunger (9.1 percentage points; P < .01), and considerable even for those who are food insecure (7.4 percentage points; P < .05). Conclusions. Findings point to a spillover “income effect” as SNAP may help older adults better afford their medications, conceivably by reducing out-of-pocket food expenditures. When prescribing treatment plans, health systems and payers have a vested interest in connecting older patients to SNAP and other resources that may help address barriers to care.

Abstract: Objectives. To evaluate rates of member compliance with Iowa’s Medicaid expansion premium disincentive program. Methods. We used 2014 to 2015 Iowa Medicaid data to construct rolling 12-month cohorts of Wellness Plan and Marketplace Choice members (Iowa’s 2 Medicaid expansion waiver programs for individuals £ 100% and 101%–138% of the federal poverty level, respectively), calculated completion rates for required activities (i.e., wellness examinations and health risk assessments), and identified factors associated with program compliance. Results. Overall, 18.5% of Wellness Plan and 12.5% of Marketplace Choice members completed both activities (P < .001). From 2014 to 2015, completion rates for both activities decreased for Wellness Plan members but increased for Marketplace Choice members. Members who were younger, male, or non-White were less likely to complete required activities. Conclusions. Approximately 81% of Wellness Plan members and 87% of Marketplace Choice members failed to comply with program requirements and should have been subject to paying premiums the following year or face disenrollment. Disparities in completion rates may exacerbate disparities in insurance coverage and health outcomes. Public Health Implications. As states consider establishing Medicaid premium disincentive programs they should anticipate challenges to successful implementation.(

Abstract: Objectives. To evaluate legal and administrative feasibility of a federal “junk” food (including sugar-sweetened beverages [SSBs]) tax to improve diet. Methods. To assess food definitions and administration models, we systematically searched (1) PubMed (through May 15, 2017) for articles defining foods subject to taxes, and legal and legislative databases as well as online for (2) US federal, state, and tribal junk food tax bills and laws (January 1, 2012–February 28, 2017); SSB taxes (January 1, 2014–February 28, 2017); and international junk food tax laws (as of February 28, 2017); and (3) federal taxing mechanisms and administrative methods (as of February 28, 2017). Results. Articles recommend taxing foods by product category, broad nutrient criteria, specific nutrients or calories, or a combination. US junk food tax bills (n = 6) and laws (n = 3), international junk food laws (n = 2), and US SSB taxes (n = 10) support taxing foods using category-based (n = 8), nutrient-based (n = 1), or combination (n = 12) approaches. Federal taxing mechanisms (particularly manufacturer excise taxes on alcohol) and administrative methods provide informative models. Conclusions. From legal and administrative perspectives, a federal junk food tax appears feasible based on product categories or combination category-plus-nutrient approaches, using a manufacturer excise tax, with additional support for sugar and graduated tax strategies.

Abstract: Objectives. To assess how the 2012 Affordable Care Act (ACA) policy change, which required most private health insurance plans to cover lactation-support services and breastfeeding equipment (without cost-sharing), affected breastfeeding outcomes. Methods. We used a regression-adjusted difference-in-differences approach with cross-sectional observational data from the US National Immunization Survey from 2008 to 2014 to estimate the effect of the ACA policy change on breastfeeding outcomes, including initiation, duration, and age at first formula feeding. The sample included children aged 19 to 23 months covered by private health insurance or Medicaid. Results. The ACA policy change was associated with an increase in breastfeeding duration by 10% (0.57 months; P = .007) and duration of exclusive breastfeeding by 21% (0.74 months; P = .001) among the eligible population. Results indicate no significant effects on breastfeeding initiation and age at first formula feeding. Conclusions. Reducing barriers to receiving support services and breastfeeding equipment shows promise as part of a broader effort to encourage breastfeeding, particularly the duration of breastfeeding and the amount of time before formula supplementation.

Abstract: Objectives. To determine if the Power Through Choices (PTC) intervention can increase the use of birth control and reduce pregnancy among system-involved youths living in group care homes. Methods. We performed a 2-arm cluster randomized controlled trial involving group care homes operated by child welfare or juvenile justice systems in California, Maryland, and Oklahoma with assessments immediately before and after the intervention, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. We collected data from 2012 to 2014 via self-administered questionnaires. Participants (n = 1036) were young (mean age = 16.1 years), predominantly male (79%), racially/ethnically diverse (37% Hispanic, 20% Black, 21% White, 17% multiracial), and sexually experienced (88%). Results. At 6-month follow-up, participants in the intervention group had significantly lower odds of having recent sexual intercourse without using birth control (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.52, 0.98). At 12-month follow-up assessment, participants in the intervention group had significantly lower odds of ever being pregnant or getting someone pregnant (AOR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.46, 0.99). Conclusions. The results suggest that PTC is an effective sexual health education intervention that can be implemented with system-involved youths who represent a sexually experienced multiracial youth population.

Abstract: This essay focuses on the use of the concept of “arrest” in Hansen’s disease (leprosy) in the United States in the early to middle part of the 20th century, as well as the transformations the concept underwent with the arrival of sulfone drugs and the implications of these changes for patients and public health officers. An “arrest” was a therapeutic outcome characterized by a long course of treatment, noncontagiousness, a very small chance of reactivation, and a need for postdischarge maintenance that depended on sociomedical infrastructures beyond the clinic as well as self-imposed lifestyle limitations. The concept of disease arrest shows that experts and laypeople alike have valued therapeutic outcomes other than “cure” that signal certain optimal therapeutic milestones, despite the practical difficulties they imply and despite the fact that they do not promise a return to a pre-illness stage.

Abstract: Social Impact Bonds (SIBs) represent a new way to finance social service and health promotion programs whereby different types of investors provide an upfront investment of capital. If a given program meets predetermined criteria for a successful outcome, the government pays back investors with interest. Introduced in the United Kingdom in 2010, SIBs have since been implemented in the United States and across Europe, with some uptake in other jurisdictions. We identify and explore selected areas of concern related to SIBs, drawing from literature examining market-based reforms to health and social services and the evolution of the SIB funding mechanism. These areas of concern include increased costs to governments, restricted program scope, fragmented policymaking, undermining of public-sector service provision, mischaracterization of the root causes of social problems, and entrenchment of systemically produced vulnerabilities. We argue that it is essential to consider the long-term, aggregate, and contextualized effects of SIBs in order to evaluate their potential to contribute to public health. We conclude that such evaluations must explore the assumptions underlying the “common sense” arguments often used in support of SIBs.

Abstract: The accepted wisdom about the US overdose crisis singles out prescribing as the causative vector. Although drug supply is a key factor, we posit that the crisis is fundamentally fueled by economic and social upheaval, its etiology closely linked to the role of opioids as a refuge from physical and psychological trauma, concentrated disadvantage, isolation, and hopelessness. Overreliance on opioid medications is emblematic of a health care system that incentivizes quick, simplistic answers to complex physical and mental health needs. In an analogous way, simplistic measures to cut access to opioids offer illusory solutions to this multidimensional societal challenge. We trace the crisis’ trajectory through the intertwined use of opioid analgesics, heroin, and fentanyl analogs, and we urge engaging the structural determinants lens to address this formidable public health emergency. Abroad focusonsuffering should guide both patient- and community-level interventions.

Abstract: Objectives. To determine the prevalence trends of osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and other types of arthritis in the United States from 1999 to 2014. Methods. We analyzed data on 43 706 community-dwelling adults aged 20 years and older who participated in the 1999–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. We accounted for survey design and sampling weights so that estimates were nationally representative. We assessed temporal trends in age-standardized arthritis prevalence by using joinpoint regression. Results. Age-adjusted prevalence of arthritis was 24.7% (OA = 9.7%; RA = 4.2%; other arthritis = 2.8%; “don’t know” type = 8.0%). Prevalence of OA increased from 6.6% to 14.3%, whereas RA prevalence decreased from 5.9% to 3.8%. Increase in OA prevalence was significant in both genders; in non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, and Hispanics; and in people with high socioeconomic status. Decrease in RA prevalence was more pronounced in men, non-Hispanic Blacks, and participants with low income or obesity. Conclusions. Between 1999 and 2014, nearly one quarter of American adults reported arthritis. The prevalence of OA has more than doubled over time whereas RA prevalence has declined.

Abstract: Objectives. To determine whether the 2014 Medicaid expansions facilitated by the Affordable Care Act affected overall and early-stage cancer diagnosis for nonelderly adults. Methods. We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Cancer Registry data from 2010 through 2014 to estimate a difference-in-differences model of cancer diagnosis rates, both overall and by stage, comparing changes in county-level diagnosis rates in US states that expanded Medicaid in 2014 with those that did not expand Medicaid. Results. Among the 611 counties in this study, Medicaid expansion was associated with an increase in overall cancer diagnoses of 13.8 per 100 000 population (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.7, 26.9), or 3.4%. Medicaid expansion was also associated with an increase in early-stage diagnoses of 15.4 per 100 000 population (95% CI = 5.4, 25.3), or 6.4%. There was no detectable impact on late-stage diagnoses. Conclusions. In their first year, the 2014 Medicaid expansions were associated with an increase in cancer diagnosis, particularly at the early stage, in the working-age population. Public Health Implications. Expanding public health insurance may be an avenue for improving cancer detection, which is associated with improved patient outcomes, including reduced mortality.

Abstract: Background. Data suggest that adverse social determinants during adolescence can set in motion a lifetime of poor social and health outcomes. Vulnerable youths are at particularly high risk in this regard. Objectives. To identify and assess the current evidence base for adolescent-focused interventions designed to influence adulthood preparation that could affect longer-term social determinants. Search Methods. Using a systematic review methodology, we conducted an initial assessment of intervention evaluations targeting 6 adulthood preparation subject (APS) areas to assess the quality and character of the evidence base. The review is specific to evaluated interventions that address at least 1 of the 6 APS areas: healthy relationships, adolescent development, financial literacy, parent–child communication, educational and career success, and healthy life skills. Selection Criteria. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) published in English in an independent, peer-reviewed journal; (2) conducted in developed, English-speaking countries; (3) implemented an intervention that addressed at least 1 of the 6 APS areas, delivered in an in-person setting; (4) included youths at the 5th- through 12th-grade levels or aged 10 to 18 years at some point during intervention implementation; (5) included an evaluation component with a comparison group and baseline and follow-up measures; (6) included behavioral measures as outcomes; and (7) reported statistical significance levels for the behavioral outcome measures. Data Collection and Analysis. We developed an abstraction form to capture details from each article, including key details of the intervention, such as services, implementer characteristics, and timing; adulthood preparation foci; evaluation design, methods, and key behavioral measures; and results, including key statistically significant results for behavior-based outcome measures. We assessed study quality by using several key factors, including randomization, baseline equivalence of treatment and control groups, attrition, and confounding factors. We characterized the quality of evidence as high, moderate, or low on the basis of the described design and execution of the research. Our assessment included only information stated explicitly in the manuscript. Main Results. A total of 36 independent intervention evaluations met the criteria for inclusion. Of these, 27 (75%) included significant findings for behavioral outcomes related to adulthood preparation. Quality was mixed across studies. Of the 36 studies reviewed, 27 used a randomized controlled design (15 group randomization, 12 individual randomization), whereas the others used observational pre–post designs. Ten studies used mixed-methods approaches. Most (n = 32) studies used self-report questionnaires at baseline with a follow-up questionnaire, and 14 studies included multiple follow-up points.

Abstract: Background. Dental diseases are among the most prevalent conditions worldwide, with universal access to dental care being one key to tackling them. Systematic quantification of inequalities in dental service utilization is needed to identify where these are most pronounced, assess factors underlying the inequalities, and evaluate changes in inequalities with time. Objectives. To evaluate the presence and extent of inequalities in dental services utilization. Search Methods. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis by searching 3 electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Database), covering the period from January 2005 to April 2017. Selection Criteria. We included observational studies investigating the association between regular dental service utilization and sex, ethnicity, place of living, educational or income or occupational position, or insurance coverage status. Two reviewers undertook independent screening of studies and made decisions by consensus. Data Collection and Analysis. Our primary outcome was the presence and extent of inequalities in dental service utilization, measured as relative estimates (usually odds ratios [ORs]) comparing different (high and low utilization) groups. We performed random effects meta-analysis and subgroup analyses by region, and we used meta-regression to assess whether and how associations changed with time. Main Results. A total of 117 studies met the inclusion criteria. On the basis of 7 830 810 participants, dental services utilization was lower in male than female participants (OR = 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.74, 0.95; P < .001); ethnic minorities or immigrants than ethnic majorities or natives (OR = 0.71; 95% CI = 0.59, 0.82; P < .001); those living in rural than those living in urban places (OR = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.76, 0.97; P = .011); those with lower than higher educational position (OR = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.55, 0.68; P < .001) or income (OR = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.54, 0.79; P < .001); and among those without insurance coverage status than those with such status (OR = 0.58; 95% CI = 0.49, 0.68; P < .001). Occupational status (OR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.81, 1.09; P = .356) had no significant impact on utilization. The observed inequalities did not significantly change over the assessed 12-year period and were universally present. Authors’ Conclusions. Inequalities in dental service utilization are both considerable and globally consistent. Public Health Implications. The observed inequalities in dental services utilization can be assumed to significantly cause or aggravate existing dental health inequalities. Policymakers should address the physical, socioeconomic, or psychological causes underlying the inequalities in utilization.

Abstract: We describe school-based screening events in four Detroit, Michigan public high schools. To examine trends, we analyzed Chlamydia trachomatis data from 2010 to 2015. Prevalence of C. trachomatis decreased significantly (P < .01): from 10.24% to 6.27%. Future school-based screening events may bring about similar results if the program is instituted in a high-prevalence area and can achieve high student participation.

Abstract: Objectives. To evaluate effects of 2 alcohol prevention interventions—Communities Mobilizing for Change on Alcohol (CMCA), a community organizing intervention designed to reduce youth alcohol access, and CONNECT, an individual-level screening and brief intervention approach—on other drug use outcomes. Methods. We conducted a community intervention trial with quarterly surveys over 3 years (2012–2015) of high school students living within the jurisdictional service area of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma. We used generalized estimating equations and linear probability models to examine intervention spillover effects on other drug use. Results. We found significant reductions in drug use other than alcohol attributable to CMCA and CONNECT. CMCA was associated with a 35% reduction in chewing tobacco use, a 39% reduction in marijuana use, and a 48% reduction in prescription drug misuse. CONNECT was associated with a 26% reduction in marijuana use and a 31% reduction in prescription drug misuse. Conclusions. Nonalcohol drug use was consistently reduced as a result of 2 theoretically and operationally distinct alcohol prevention strategies. Evaluations of alcohol prevention efforts should continue to include other drug use to understand the broader effects of such interventions.

Abstract: Objectives. To determine the proportion of restaurants that will be required to post calorie information under the Food and Drug Administration’s menu-labeling regulations in 4 New Jersey cities. Methods. We classified geocoded 2014 data on 1753 restaurant outlets in accordance with the Food and Drug Administration’s guidelines, which will require restaurants with 20 or more locations nationwide to post calorie information. We used multivariate logistic regression analyses to assess the association between menu-labeling requirements and census tract characteristics. Results. Only 17.6% of restaurants will be affected by menu labeling; restaurants in higher-income tracts have higher odds than do restaurants in lower-income tracts (odds ratio [OR] = 1.55; P = .02). Restaurants in non-Hispanic Black (OR = 1.62; P = .02) and mixed race/ethnicity (OR = 1.44; P = .05) tracts have higher odds than do restaurants in non-Hispanic White tracts of being affected. Conclusions. Additional strategies are needed to help consumers make healthy choices at restaurants not affected by the menu-labeling law. These findings have implications for designing implementation strategies for the law and for evaluating its impact.

Abstract: Objectives. To compare US trends in rates of injection drug use (IDU), specifically opioid injection, with national trends in the incidence of acute HCV infection to assess whether these events correlated over time. Methods. We calculated the annual incidence rate and demographic and risk characteristics of reported cases of acute HCV infection using surveillance data from 2004 to 2014 and the annual percentage of admissions to substance use disorder treatment facilities reporting IDU for the same time period by type of drug injected and demographic characteristics. We then tested for trends. Results. The annual incidence rate of acute HCV infection increased more than 2-fold (from 0.3 to 0.7 cases/100 000) from 2004 to 2014, with significant increases among select demographic subgroups. Admissions for substance use disorder attributed to injection of heroin and prescription opioid analgesics increased significantly, with an almost 4-fold increase in prescription opioid analgesic injection. Significant increases in opioid injection mirrored those for reported cases of acute HCV infection among demographic subgroups. Conclusions. These findings strongly suggest that the national increase in acute HCV infection is related to the country’s opioid epidemic and associated increases in IDU.

Abstract: Objectives. To investigate the prevalence and associated factors of hearing aid acquisition in Chinese older adults. Methods. We obtained data from a population-based survey on ear and hearing disorders, which was conducted in 4 provinces of China in 2014 to 2015. Trained examiners conducted pure tone audiometry and audiologists further ascertained for hearing loss. We relied on hearing conditions and audiologists’ recommendations to identify 1503 participants who needed to wear hearing aids. Results. Among those 1503 participants, the estimated prevalence of hearing aid acquisition was 6.5% (95% confidence interval = 5.3%, 7.8%). Urban residency, having severe hearing loss, understanding hearing aid function, and receiving a hearing test in the past 12 months were associated with elevated prevalence of hearing aid acquisition. The top-3 reported reasons for not acquiring a hearing aid were not understanding its function (25.4%), not needing it (22.3%), and not being able to afford it (21.3%). Conclusions. Hearing aid use, as a widespread rehabilitation and treatment of hearing loss, remains a big challenge in China. Apart from providing low-cost hearing aids, more efforts should focus on improving hearing knowledge and disseminating information about hearing aid function among older adults.

Abstract: Objectives. To examine elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs) in refugee children by postrelocation duration with control for several covariates. Methods. We assessed EBLLs (‡ 5mg/dL) between 2012 and 2016 of children younger than 15 years (n = 1950) by the duration of resettlement to health screening by using logistic regression, with control for potential confounders (gender, region of birth, age of housing, and intestinal infestation) in a cross-sectional study. Results. Prevalence of EBLLs was 11.2%. Length of time from resettlement to health screening was inversely associated with EBLLs (tertile 2 unadjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.56, 1.12; tertile 3 OR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.42, 0.90; tertile 2 adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.39, 0.97; tertile 3 AOR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.34, 0.93). There was a significant interaction between intestinal infestation and age of housing (P < .003), indicating significant risk in the joint exposure of intestinal infestation (a pica proxy) and age of house. Conclusions. Elevated blood lead levels were reduced with increasing length of time of resettlement in unadjusted and adjusted models. Improved housing, early education, and effective safe-house inspections may be necessary to address EBLLs in refugees.

Abstract: Objectives. To determine factors associated with mortality among confirmed Lassa fever cases. Methods. We reviewed line lists and clinical records of laboratory-confirmed cases of Lassa fever during the 2016 outbreak in Nigeria to determine factors associated with mortality. We activated an incident command system to coordinate response. Results. We documented 47 cases, 28 of whom died (case fatality rate [CFR] = 59.6%; mean age 31.4 years; SD = 618.4 years). The youngest and the oldest were the most likely to die, with 100% mortality in those aged 5 years or younger and those aged 55 years or older. Patients who commenced ribavirin were more likely to survive (odds ratio [OR] = 0.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.03, 0.50). Fatality rates went from 100% (wave 1) through 69% (wave 2) to 31% (wave 3; c2 for linear trend: P &lt; .01). Patients admitted to a health care center before incident command system activation were more likely to die (OR = 4.4; 95% CI = 1.1, 17.6). The only pregnant patient in the study died postpartum. Conclusions. Effective, coordinated response reduces mortality from public health events. Attention to vulnerable groups during disasters is essential. Public Health Implications. Activating an incident command system improves the outcome of disasters in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Objectives: To measure the risk of concussion among New Mexico middle and high school students during both sports and physical education. Methods: Athletic directors or athletic trainers in 147 schools were askedto report the number of concussions occurring during sports and physical education in the 2013 to 2014 school year. We calculated 1-year cumulative incidence rates. Results: Of the 147 schools,99 responded (67%). During the school year, 598 students were removed from athletics because of a concussion, a 1-year cumulative incidence of 3.5 per 100. The concussion rate during sports was 3.0:3.5 for boys and 2.4 for girls (relative risk [RR] =1.5;95% confidence interval [CI]=1.2, 1.7).Anadditional 335 students experienced concussions during physical education. Concussion rates during physical education were 60% higher than during sports (RR=1.6; 95% CI=1.4, 1.8). Conclusions: In our data, the risk of concussion was higher in physical education than in sports. This suggests that concussions should be tracked for a wide range of youth athletic activities, not just for sports. Monitoring cumulative incidence, in addition to other measures, may allow comparisons across schools and regions. More prevention efforts are needed.

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of an interactive, Web-based sexual health program (Health Education and Relationship Training [HEART]) for developing sexual assertiveness skills and enhancing sexual decision-making in adolescent girls. Methods: Participants were 222 tenth-grade girls (mean age=15.2; 38% White, 29% Hispanic, 25% Black)inthe Southeastern United States who were randomizedinfall 2015 to the HEART intervention or an attention-matched control. We assessed participants at pretest, immediate posttest, and 4-month follow-up. Results: Both groups had similar demographic and sexual behavior characteristics at pretest. At immediate posttest, girls who completed the HEART program demonstrated better sexual assertiveness skills measured with a behavioral task, higher self-reported assertiveness, intentions to communicate about sexual health, knowledge regarding HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), safer sex norms and attitudes, and condom self-efficacy compared with the control condition. At 4-month follow-up, group differences remained in knowledge regarding HIV and other STDs, condom attitudes, and condom self-efficacy. Conclusions: This brief online sexual health program can improve short-term outcomes among adolescent girls and offers an exciting new option in the growing array of digital health interventions available to youths.

Abstract: Objectives: To estimate changes in the prevalence of daily cannabis use among current, former, and never cigarette smokers from 2002 to 2014 in the United States. Methods: The National Survey on Drug Use and Health is a nationally representative cross-sectional study conducted annually among persons aged 12 years and older in the United States. Results: Daily cannabis use occurs nearly exclusively among nondaily and daily cigarette smokers compared with former and never smokers (8.03%, 9.01%, 2.79%, 1.05%, respectively). Daily cannabis use increased over the past decade among both nondaily (8.03% [2014] vs 2.85% [2002]; linear trend P<.001) and daily smokers (9.01% [2014]; 4.92% [2002]; linear trend P<.001). Daily cannabis use increased most rapidly among former cigarette smokers (2.79% [2014] vs 0.98% [2002]; linear trend P <.001). Conclusions: Daily cannabis use occurs predominantly among cigarette smokers in the UnitedStates. Dailycannabisuse increasedamongcurrent,former,andneversmokersover the past decade, with particularly rapid increases among youth and female cigarette smokers. Future researchis neededto monitor the observed increaseindaily cannabis use, especially among youths and adults who smoke cigarettes.

Abstract: Objectives: Topresent the first nationalestimateofthesociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral characteristics of HIV-positive transgender men receiving medical care in the United States. Methods: This analysis included pooled interview and medical record data from the 2009 to 2014 cyclesof the Medical Monitoring Project, which used a3-stage, probabilityproportional-to-size sampling methodology. Results: Transgender men accounted for 0.16%ofall adultsand 11%ofalltransgender adults receiving HIV medical care in the United States from 2009 to 2014. Of these HIV-positive transgender men receiving medical care, approximately 47% lived in poverty, 69% had at least 1 unmet ancillary service need, 23% met criteria for depression, 69% were virally suppressed at their last test, and 60% had sustained viral suppression over the previous 12 months. Conclusions: Although they constitute a small proportion of all HIV-positive patients, more than 1 in 10 transgender HIV-positive patients were transgender men. Many experienced socioeconomic challenges, unmet needs for ancillary services, and suboptimal health outcomes. Attention to the challenges facing HIV-positive transgender men may be necessary to achieve the National HIV/AIDS Strategy goals of decreasing disparities and improving health outcomes among transgender persons.

Abstract: Objectives: To detect decreases in anogenital warts (AGW) among sex and age groups likely to be affected by human papillomavirus vaccination. Methods: Weestimated annual AGW prevalence during 2006to2014 using health care claimsamongUSprivate health insurance enrollees aged15to39years.Wederived AGW diagnoses using 1 of the following: (1) condylomata acuminata diagnosis, (2) viral wart diagnosis combined with a benign anogenital neoplasm diagnosis or destruction or excision of an anogenital lesion, or (3) AGW medication combined with a benign anogenital neoplasm diagnosis or destruction or excision of an anogenital lesion. Results. Prevalence decreased during 2008 to 2014 among females aged 15 to 19 years (annual percentage change [APC]=-14.1%; P<.001) and during 2009 to 2014 among women aged 20to 24years (APC=-12.9%; P<.001) and among women aged 25 to29years (APC=-6.0%; P=.001).Weobserved significant declines among men aged 20 to24years (APC=-6.5%;P =.005). Prevalence increased orwas stableinall other sex and age groups. Conclusions: We observed AGW decreases among females in the age groups most likely to be affected by human papillomavirus vaccination and decreases in men aged 20 to 24 years. Decreased prevalence in young men is likely attributable to herd protection from vaccination among females.

Abstract: Objectives: To quantify the improvement in US life expectancy required to reach parity with high-resource nationsby 2030, to document historical precedentofthis rate, and to discuss the plausibility of achieving this rate in the United States. Methods: We performed a demographic analysis of secondary data in 5-year periods from 1985 to 2015. Results: To achieve the United Nations projected mortality estimates for Western Europe in 2030, the US life expectancy must grow at 0.32% a year between 2016 and 2030. This rate has precedent, even in low-mortality populations. Over 204 countryperiods examined, nearly half exhibited life-expectancy growth greater than 0.32%. Of the 51 US states observed, 8.2% of state-periods demonstrated life-expectancy growth that exceeded the 0.32% target. Conclusions: Achieving necessary growth in life expectancy over the next 15 years despite historical precedent will be challenging. Much all-cause mortality is structured decades earlier and, at present, older-age mortality reductions in the United States are decelerating. Addressing mortality decline at all ages will require enhanced political will and a strong commitment to equity improvement in the US population.

Abstract: Discrimination causes health inequities for stigmatized groups. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals, in particular, are at significantly increased risk for disparate health outcomes when they reside in states that fail to extend equal protections to them or that actively deprive equal rights to them. Several states and the federal government have proposed or enacted laws that permit residents to discriminate against LGBTQ individuals. One such law, Arkansas's Intrastate Commerce Improvement Act of 2015, preempts or prohibits local governments from enacting civil rights protections for LGBTQ individuals that are also lacking at the state level. State laws such as Arkansas's undermine local control, damage the economy, and create injustices that harm LGBTQ people. I set forth 2 constitutional arguments to challenge such laws, and I provide information to help advocates support evidence-based policymaking and prevent the passage of similar laws in their states.

Abstract: Objectives: To assess cohort effects in prescription opioid and heroin overdose mortality in the United States. Methods: Using the National Center for Health Statistics' multiple-cause-of-death file for 1999 to 2014, we performed an age-period-cohort analysis of drug overdose mortality in the United States. Results: Compared with those born in 1977 and 1978, individuals born between 1947 and 1964 experienced excess risks of prescription opioid overdose death (e.g., for the 1955-1956 birth cohort, rate ratio [RR] =1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.09, 1.48) and of heroin overdose death (e.g., for the 1953-1954 birth cohort, RR= 1.32; 95% CI=1.11, 1.57).Those born between 1979 and 1992 also experienced an increased riskof heroin overdose death (e.g., for the 1989-1990 birth cohort, RR=1.23; 95% CI=1.01, 1.50). The cohort effects were consistent between sexes. Conclusions: Individuals born between 1947 and 1964 and between 1979 and 1992 are particularly afflicted by the opioid epidemic. Intervention programs are needed to reduce the excess overdose mortality in these specific demographic groups.

Abstract: We define measures of effect used in public health evaluations, which include the risk difference and the risk ratio, the population-attributable risk, years of life lost or gained, disability-adjusted life years, quality-adjusted life years, and the incremental costeffectiveness ratio. Except for the risk ratio, all of these are absolute effect measures. For constructing externally generalizable absolute measures of effect when there is superior fit of the multiplicative model, we suggest using the multiplicative model to estimate relative risks, which will often be obtained in simple linear form with no interactions, and then converting these to the desired absolute measure. The externally generalizable absolute measure of effect can be obtained by suitably standardizing to the risk factor distribution of the population to which the results are to be generalized. External generalizability will often be compromised when absolute measures are computed from study populations with risk factor distributions different from those of the population to whom the results are to be generalized, even when these risk factors are not confounders of the intervention effect.

Abstract: Objectives: To assess exposure to marijuana advertising in Oregon after the start of retail marijuana sales in October 2015. Methods: We conducted a repeated cross-sectional online survey of 4001 Oregon adults aged 18 years and older in November 2015 and April-May 2016. We assessed subgroup differences by using the Pearson c2 test. Results: More than half of adults (54.8%) statewide reported seeing marijuana advertising in the past month. These adults reported that they most frequently saw storefront (74.5%), streetside (66.5%), and billboard (55.8%) advertising. Exposure did not significantly differ by participant's age or marijuana use but was higher among those living in counties with retail sales (56.5%) than in counties without (32.5%). Conclusions. Most adults reported exposure to marijuana advertising following the startofretailmarijuana salesinOregon. Peoplewhodonotusemarijuana and thoseaged 18 to 24 years were as exposed to advertising as other groups. Public Health Implications: Advertising restrictions maybeneededtoprotect youths and young adults from pro-use messages. Commercial free speech afforded by the First Amendment makes advertising restrictions challenging, but public policy experts note that restrictions aimed at protecting youths may be allowed.

Abstract: Three Hippocratic physicians played critical roles in the prosecution of 23 Nazi doctors charged with murder and torture for conducting lethal medical experiments on concentration camp prisoners. Two of the physicians, Leopold Alexander and Andrew C. Ivy, were Americans, and the other, Werner Leibbrandt, was German. At the 70th anniversary of the Doctors' Trial it is fitting to recall the three's influences and contributions to the formulation of strict research ethics rules, known as the Nuremberg Code. Their contributions help us better understand why they insisted on strict research rules and yet ultimately were unable to apply these rules to their own research. Exploring their contributions at Nuremberg may help us appreciate the continuing difficulty physician-researchers have with accepting public regulation of research.

Abstract: This article, in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Doctors' Trial at Nuremberg, reflects on the Nazi eugenics and "euthanasia" programs and their relevance for today. The Nazi doctors used eugenic ideals to justify sterilizations, child and adult "euthanasia," and, ultimately, genocide. Contemporary euthanasia has experienced a progression from voluntary to nonvoluntary and from passive to active killing. Modern eugenics has included both positive and negative selective activities. The 70th anniversary of the Doctors' Trial at Nuremberg provides an important opportunity to reflect on the implications of the Nazi eugenics and "euthanasia" programs for contemporary health law, bioethics, and human rights. In this article, we will examine the role that health practitioners played in the promotion and implementation of State-sponsored eugenics and "euthanasia" in Nazi Germany, followed by an exploration of contemporary parallels and debates in modern bioethics.1.

Abstract: Objectives: To test the applicability of the Environmental Scoring System, a quick and simple approach for quantitatively measuring environmental triggers collected during home visits, and to evaluate its contribution to improving asthma outcomes among various child asthma programs. Methods: We pooled and analyzed data from multiple child asthma programs in the Greater Boston Area, Massachusetts, collected in 2011 to 2016, to examine the association of environmental scores (ES) with measures of asthma outcomes and compare the results across programs. Results: Our analysis showed that demographics were important contributors to variability in asthma outcomes and total ES, and largely explained the differences among programs at baseline. Among all programs in general, we found that asthma outcomes were significantly improved and total ES significantly reduced over visits, with the total Asthma Control Test score negatively associated with total ES. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that the Environmental Scoring System is a useful tool for measuring home asthma triggers and can be applied regardless of program and survey designs, and that demographics of the target population may influence the improvement in asthma outcomes.

Abstract: Seventy years after the Nuremberg Doctors' Trial, health professionals and lawyers working together after 9/11 played a critical role in designing, justifying, and carrying out the US statesponsored torture program in the CIA "Black Sites" and US military detention centers, including Abu Ghraib, Bagram, and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. We analyze the similarities between the Nazi doctors and health professionals in the War on Terror and address the question of how it happened that health professionals, including doctors, psychologists, physician assistants, and nurses, acted as agents of the state to utilize their medical and healing skills to cause harm and sanitize barbarous acts, similar to (though not on the scale of) how Nazi doctors were used by the Third Reich.

Abstract: Objectives; To evaluate National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP) participation over a 7-year period before and after the implementation of the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA), which required healthier school lunch options beginning in school year (SY) 2012-2013 and healthier school breakfast options beginning in SY2013-2014. Methods: Data were gathered from low-income, high-minority public schools in 4 New Jersey cities. We conducted longitudinal analyses of annual average daily participation (ADP) in school meals among enrolled students overall and among those eligible for free or reduced-price meals. We used linear mixed models to compare NSLP and SBP participation rates from SY2008-2009 to SY2014-2015. Results: NSLP participation rates among students overall differed little across years (from 70% to 72%). SBP rates among enrolled students were stable from the beginning of the study period to SY2013-2014 and then increased from 52% to 59%. Among students eligible for free or reduced-price meals, the ADP was lowest in SY2012-2013 (when the HHFKA was implemented) before rebounding. Conclusions: The HHFKA did not have a negative impact on school meal participation over time. Public Health Implications. The HHFKA-strengthened nutrition standards have not affected school meal participation rates. With time, students are likely to accept healthier options.

Abstract: The year 2017 marks both the 70th anniversary of the Nuremberg Code and the first major revisions of federal research regulations in almost 3 decades. I suggest that the informed consent provisions of the federal research regulations continue to follow the requirements of the Nuremberg Code. However, modifications are needed to the informed consent (and institutional review board) provisions to make the revised federal regulations more effective in promoting a genuine conversation between the researcher and the research subject. This conversation must take seriously both the therapeutic illusion and the desire of both the researcher and the research subject not to engage in sharing uncertainty.

Abstract: Objectives: Toestimate the long-term association between Israeli-imposed restrictions on travel for medical care in the occupied Palestinian territory and health status in adulthood. Methods: Using event history calendar methods, we collected annual data from 1987 to 2011 from a representative sample of 1778 Palestinians aged 32 to 43 years and analyzed the subsample of whomever had a serious medical condition and needed to travel for medical care (n =246; contributing 1163 person-years). We used ordered logistic regression with person-year data to test the association between movement restrictions from 1987 to 2011 and health status in 2011. Results: Two thirds (65%; n =161) of participants reported travel restrictions, and 38% (n =92) reported ever being barred from travel for medical care. Compared with study participants who experiencednotravel restrictions inayear (n=559 person-years), those who were barred from travel in that same year (n=122 person-years) reported worse self-rated health (57% vs 22% reported bad or very bad self-rated health; P<.05) and greater limits on daily functioning caused by physical health (41% vs 16% reported regular limits; P <.05). Conclusions: Being barred from travel for medical care was associated with poor health as long as 25 years later.
