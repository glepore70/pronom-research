Abstract: A school-based, bilingual intervention was developed to increase seat belt use among families living along the Texas-Mexico border. The intervention sought to increase seat belt use by changing perceived norms within the community (i.e., making the nonuse of seat belts less socially acceptable). The intervention was implemented in more than 110 classrooms and involved more than 2100 children. Blind coding, validity checks, and reliability estimates contributed to a rigorous program evaluation. Seat belt use increased by 10% among children riding in the front seat of motor vehicles in the intervention community, as compared with a small but nonsignificant decline in use among control community children. Seat belt use among drivers did not increase.

Abstract: Objectives. Using opinion data from experts, we examined the context of the argument for mandatory testing of psychiatric patients. Methods. Vignettes were distributed to experts on HIV and mental illness. Respondents were asked to provide appropriateness ratings for different hypothetical clinical decisions regarding HIV management. Results. Respondents were reluctant to impose testing without informed consent in most circumstances. The presence of risk factors or danger to another increased appropriateness ratings modestly. Conclusions. Despite experts' tendency to emphasize individual rights, public reluctance to mandate testing is unlikely to extend to people with serious mental illness. No argument for mandatory testing can be persuasive if improved voluntary testing can achieve adequate detection rates. Voluntary testing protocols should be studied to determine which successfully identify infected individuals.

Abstract: Objectives. In this study we explored the association between rates of household firearm ownership and homicide across the United States, by age groups. Methods. We used cross-sectional time-series data (1988-1997) to estimate the association between rates of household firearm ownership and homicide. Results. In region- and state-level analyses, a robust association between rates of household firearm ownership and homicide was found. Regionally, the association exists for victims aged 5 to 14 years and those 35 years and older. At the state level, the association exists for every age group over age 5, even after controlling for poverty, urbanization, unemployment, alcohol consumption, and nonlethal violent crime. Conclusions. Although our study cannot determine causation, we found that in areas where household firearm ownership rates were higher, a disproportionately large number of people died from homicide.

Title: Adverse effects of US jail and prison policies on the health and well-being of women of color

Volume: 92
Issue: 12
Pages: 1895-1899
Abstract: In the past few decades, US policies have led to an unprecedented increase in the number of people behind bars. While more men than women are incarcerated, the rate of increase for women has been higher. Evidence of the negative impact of incarceration on the health of women of color suggests strategies to reduce these adverse effects. Correctional policies contribute to disparities in health between White women and women of color, providing a public health rationale for policy change. Specific roles for health professionals include becoming involved in alliances addressing alternatives to incarceration, creating programs that address the needs of women in correctional facilities, and identifying the pathways by which correctional policies damage health.

Abstract: The Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS) is the central repository of medical surveillance data for the US armed forces. The DMSS integrates data from sources worldwide in a continuously-expanding relational database that documents the military and medical experiences of servicemembers throughout their careers. The Department of Defense Serum Repository (DoDSR) is a central archive of sera drawn from servicemembers for medical surveillance purposes. Currently, the DMSS contains data relevant to more than 7 million individuals who have served in the armed forces since 1990, and the DoDSR contains more than 27 million specimens that are linkable to data in the DMSS. Recent applications of the DMSS and DoDSR provide glimpses of the capabilities and uses of comprehensive public health surveillance systems.

Abstract: Objectives. This study measured the prevalence of battering victimization (i.e., experience of psychological/symbolic, physical, and sexual battering) among men who have sex with men (MSM) and identified characteristics of these men. Methods. A probability-based sample of 2881 MSM living in 4 cities completed telephone interviews between 1996 and 1998. Results. Prevalence estimates were 34% for psychological/symbolic battering, 22% for physical battering, and 5% for sexual battering. The strongest demographic correlate independently associated with all forms of battering was age 40 or younger, whereas education and HIV serostatus were associated with physical and psychological/symbolic violence. Conclusions. Rates of battering victimization among urban MSM are substantially higher than among heterosexual men and possibly heterosexual women. Public health efforts directed toward addressing intimate partner battering among these men are needed.

Abstract: Objectives. We compared knowledge of, attitudes toward, and experience with complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) among Western medicine-trained doctors (WMDs) and Oriental medicine-trained doctors (OMDs). Methods. In Korea, 502 WMDs and 500 OMDs were interviewed with a structured questionnaire. Results. OMDs held more favorable attitudes toward CAM than did WMDs. OMDs possessed a deeper understanding of and greater experience with CAM. OMDs more readily endorsed health beliefs congruent with CAM. Conclusions. In the future, CAM can be more readily used by OMDs than by WMDs. Because evidence for the effectiveness of CAM remains sparse, more research is needed for the prudent use of CAM in Korea. An education and training system for potential CAM providers remains to be developed.

Abstract: Objectives. We developed and evaluated a statewide and community-level asthma surveillance system. Methods. Databases and measures included a community prevalence survey, hospital admissions data, emergency department/outpatient clinic visit records, and a physician survey of diagnosis and treatment practices. We evaluated the system in 5 Maine communities varying in population and income. Results. Asthma hospitalizations were high in the rural/low-socioeconomic-status communities studied, although diagnosed asthma was low. Males were more likely than females to experience asthma symptoms, although they were less likely to have been diagnosed with asthma or to have used hospital-based asthma care. Conclusions. Databases were useful for estimating asthma burden and identifying service needs as well as high-risk groups. They were less useful in estimating severity or in identifying environmental risks.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined trends and racial disparities (White, African American) in trimester of prenatal care initiation and adequacy of prenatal care utilization for US women and specific high-risk subgroups, e.g., unmarried, young, or less-educated mothers. Methods. Data from 1981-1998 US natality files on singleton live births to US resident mothers were examined. Results. Overall, early and adequate use of care improved for both racial groups, and racial disparities in prenatal care use have been markedly reduced, except for some young mothers. Conclusions. While improvements are evident, it is doubtful that the Healthy People 2000 objective for prenatal care will soon be attained for African Americans or Whites. Further efforts are needed to understand influences on and to address barriers to prenatal care.

Abstract: In Russia, rates of alcohol consumption and homicide are among the highest in the world, and already-high levels increased dramatically after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Rates of both, however, vary greatly among Russia's 89 regions. We took advantage of newly available vital statistics and socioeconomic data to examine the regional covariation of drinking and lethal violence. Log-log models were employed to estimate the impact of alcohol consumption on regional homicide rates, controlling for structural factors thought to influence the spatial distribution of homicide rates. Results revealed a positive and significant relationship between alcohol consumption and homicide, with a 1% increase in regional consumption of alcohol associated with an approximately 0.25% increase in homicide rates. In Russia, higher regional rates of alcohol consumption are associated with higher rates of homicide.

Village leaders, teachers, and women and youth leaders were recruited to participate in the program. Community activities were organized and intervention activities in schools were implemented. Incidence of new drug users was estimated. Results. There was a 2.7-fold greater reduction in drug use initiation in the intervention area (1.59% vs 0.60%). Reduction was highest among males aged 15 to 19, single men, illiterate men, and the Jingpo minority. HIV/AIDS knowledge and attitudes and recognition of drug problems were all significantly better in the intervention area. Conclusions. Community-based intervention programs to prevent drug use can be successful in rural areas of China.

Abstract: The primary goal of HIV prevention is to prevent as many infections as possible. This requires allocating HIV-prevention resources according to cost-effectiveness principles: those activities that prevent more infections per dollar are favored over those that prevent fewer. This is not current practice in the United States, where prevention resources from the federal government to the states flow in proportion to reported AIDS cases. Although such allocations might be considered equitable, more infections could be prevented for the same expenditures were cost-effectiveness principles invoked. The downside of pure cost-effective allocations is that they violate common norms of equity. In this article, we argue for a middle ground that promotes both equity and efficiency in allocating federal HIV-prevention resources.

Abstract: A wound and abscess clinic, held concurrently with a syringe exchange, provided economical treatment and aftercare for injection-associated soft tissue infections. During 20 two-hour clinic sessions, 173 treatment episodes were logged, and the visit cost was estimated at $5 per patient. Increased patient-clinician interactions provided opportunities beyond those afforded by the syringe exchange for patients to obtain resources and referrals to services such as HIV counseling and testing, medical care, and drug treatment. Distribution of cards advertising the clinic was substantially less effective than word of mouth in increasing community awareness of the clinic.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined recent public-sector trends in childhood vaccine costs and estimated future costs. Methods. We used public-sector price data to calculate vaccine purchase cost per child for children aged 0 to 6 years from 1975 to 2001. We fit a linear regression model to historical data and then used it to project costs per child from 2002 to 2020, adjusted to 2001 US dollars. Results. Controlling for inflation, the cost of vaccine purchase per child climbed from $10 in 1975 to $385 in 2001. The cost of vaccine purchase in the year 2020 following recommendation of 7 additional vaccines is estimated to be $1225 per child (95% confidence interval= $891, $1559). Conclusions. The cost per child for recommended vaccines at public-sector prices may triple over the next 2 decades. These projections have implications for vaccine financing at federal and state levels.

Abstract: Objectives. Race-specific health statistics are routinely reported in scientific publications; most describe health disparities across groups. Census 2000 showed that 2.4% of the US population identifies with more than 1 race group. We examined the hypothesis that multiple-race reporting is associated with interracial births by comparing parental race reported on birth certificates with reported race in a national health survey. Methods. US natality data from 1968 through 1998 and National Health Interview Survey data from 1990 through 1998 were compared, by year of birth. Results. Overall multiple-race survey responses correspond to expectations from interracial births. However, there are discrepancies for specific multiple-race combinations. Conclusions. Projected estimates of the multiple-race population can be only partially informed by vital records.

Using data from a cross-sectional survey of US chiropractors and data from the Bureau of Health Professions' Area Resource File, we conducted multiple linear and logistic regression modeling of the effects of rural or Health Professional Shortage Area location on chiropractic practice volume and wait times. Results. Chiropractors in rural and high-shortage areas have busier, higher-volume practices than do those in other locales (after control for other chiropractors in the same market service area). Conclusions. Chiropractic providers render a substantial amount of care to underserved and rural populations. Health policy planners should consider the full complement of providers available to improve access to care.

We analyzed unlinked HIV antibody data on 61120 specimens from 7 public health centers in Los Angeles County from 1993 to 1999. Results. Most (87%) immigrant clients were Central American/Mexican -born. HIV prevalence was similar for US- and foreign-born clients (1.8% [95% confidence interval (CI)=1.7%, 1.9%] and 1.6% [95% CI=1.5%, 1.8%], respectively). Seroprevalence was high among sub-Saharan African females and low among Asian/Pacific Islander males and females. For HIV-positive immigrants, the average age at and time since immigration were 20.6 years and 12.3 years, respectively. Conclusions. The relatively young age at arrival and long time since arrival for HIV-positive foreign-born clients suggest that most were infected after immigration.

Abstract: Objectives. This study estimated the impact of red light camera enforcement on motor vehicle crashes in one of the first US communities to employ such cameras - Oxnard, California. Methods. Crash data were analyzed for Oxnard and for 3 comparison cities. Changes in crash frequencies were compared for Oxnard and control cities and for signalized and nonsignalized intersections by means of a generalized linear regression model. Results. Overall, crashes at signalized intersections throughout Oxnard were reduced by 7% and injury crashes were reduced by 29%. Right-angle crashes, those most associated with red light violations, were reduced by 32%; right-angle crashes involving injuries were reduced by 68%. Conclusions. Because red light cameras can be a permanent component of the transportation infrastructure, crash reductions attributed to camera enforcement should be sustainable.

Abstract: Objectives. This study investigated the impact of HIV voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) on reproduction planning among 1634 adults in 2 sub-Saharan countries. Methods. Data were obtained from a multisite randomized controlled trial. Results. At 6 months post-VCT, the women more likely to be pregnant were younger (odds ratio [OR]=2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.0, 6.5), not using contraceptives (OR=0.1; 95% CI=0.1, 0.3), and HIV infected (OR=3.0; 95% CI=1.3, 7.0). An interaction emerged linking pregnancy intention at baseline and HIV serostatus with pregnancy at follow-up (OR= 0.1; 95% CI=.0, 0.4) Partner pregnancy rates did not differ by HIV serostatus among men. Conclusions. HIV diagnosis may influence reproduction planning for women but not for men.

Abstract: Objectives. This study describes the relationship between dental needs and dental care utilization among children. Methods. Data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994) were used to analyze dental care needs and dental care utilization. Results. Younger children with perceived needs (needs perceived by the child or responsible adult) were more likely to be episodic users of dental care than children without perceived needs. Younger children with normative needs (defined by the presence of untreated caries diagnosed by a dentist) were less likely to be regular users. Older children with perceived or normative needs were more likely to be episodic users and less likely to have had a previous-year visit than children with no needs. Conclusions. Despite their presence, dental needs do not drive dental care use among children, and children's dental care utilization is inadequate.

Abstract: Although community development and social change are not explicit goals of community-oriented primary care (COPC), they are implicit in COPC's emphasis on community organization and local participation with health professionals in the assessment of health problems. These goals are also implicit in the shared understanding of health problems' social, physical, and economic causes and in the design of COPC interventions. In the mid-1960s, a community health center in the Mississippi Delta created programs designed to move beyond narrowly focused disease-specific interventions and address some of the root causes of community morbidity and mortality. Drawing on the skills of the community itself, a self-sustaining process of health-related social change was initiated. A key program involved the provision of educational opportunities.

Abstract: Dallas County, Texas, is the site of the largest urban application of the community-oriented primary care (COPC) model in the United States. We summarize the development and implementation of Dallas's Parkland Health & Hospital System COPC program. The complexities of implementing and managing this comprehensive community-based program are delineated in terms of Dallas County's political environment and the components of COPC (assessment, prioritization, community collaboration, health care system, evaluation, and financing). Steps to be taken to ensure the future growth and development of the Dallas program are also considered. The COPC model, as implemented by Parkland, is replicable in other urban areas.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the patterns and correlates of maternal smoking before, during, and after pregnancy. Methods. We examined socioeconomic, demographic, and clinical risk factors associated with maternal smoking in a nationally representative cohort of women (n=8285) who were surveyed 17 ± 5 months and again 35 ± 5 months after delivery. Results. Smoking rates among women with a college degree decreased 30% from before pregnancy to 35 months postpartum but did not change among the least educated women. Risk factors clustered, and a gradient linked the number of risk factors (0, 2, 4) to the percentage smoking (6%, 31%, 58%, P<.0001). Conclusions. The period of pregnancy and early parenthood is associated with worsening education-related disparities in smoking as well as substantial clustering of risk factors. These observations could influence the targeting and design of maternal smoking interventions.

Abstract: Objectives. This study developed national estimates of the burden of selected infectious diseases among correctional inmates and releasees during 1997. Methods. Data from surveys, surveillance, and other reports were synthesized to develop these estimates. Results. During 1997, 20% to 26% of all people living with HIV in the United States, 29% to 43% of all those infected with the hepatitis C virus, and 40% of all those who had tuberculosis disease in that year passed through a correctional facility. Conclusions. Correctional facilities are critical settings for the efficient delivery of prevention and treatment interventions for infectious diseases. Such interventions stand to benefit not only inmates, their families, and partners, but also the public health of the communities to which inmates return.

Abstract: Objectives. We estimated the prevalence and longitudinal correlates of use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) at midlife among participants of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN). Methods. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between baseline survey-reported symptoms and use of herbal, spiritual, and physical manipulation therapies 1 year later. Results. Almost half of all women had used CAM in the past year. Baseline psychological symptoms were associated with subsequent use of spiritual therapies among White and Chinese women. Baseline CAM use was a major predictor of subsequent use in White, Japanese, and Chinese women. Conclusions. Baseline CAM use, rather than presence of symptoms, was the major predictor of subsequent CAM use. Premenopausal health behaviors are important determinants of choice of therapy during midlife.

Abstract: Since its inception in rural, pre-apartheid South Africa, community-oriented primary care (COPC) has intrigued and informed public health and primary care leaders worldwide. COPC has influenced such programs as the US community health center movement, the general practice movement in the United Kingdom, and recent reforms in the public health system of South Africa. We provide a global overview of COPC, tracing its conceptual roots, reviewing its many manifestations, and exploring its future prospects as an organizational paradigm for the democratic organization of community health services. We examine the pitfalls and paradoxes of COPC and suggest its future utility. COPC has important values and methods to offer disparate but powerful movements in public health worldwide.

Abstract: Objectives. This study presents results from a national survey of US physicians that assessed screening, case reporting, partner management, and clinical practices for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HIV infection. Methods. Surveys were mailed to a random sample of 7300 physicians to assess screening, testing, reporting, and partner notification for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HIV. Results. Fewer than one third of physicians routinely screened men or women (pregnant or nonpregnant) for STDs. Case reporting was lowest for chlamydia (37%), intermediate for gonorrhea (44%), and higher for syphilis, HIV, and AIDS (53%-57%). Physicians instructed patients to notify their partners (82%-89%) or the health department (25%-34%) rather than doing so themselves. Conclusions. STD screening levels are well below practice guidelines for women and virtually nonexistent for men. Case reporting levels are below those legally mandated; physicians rely instead on patients for partner notification. Health departments must increase collaboration with private physicians to improve the quality of STD care.

Abstract: Community-oriented primary care (COPC) developed and was tested over nearly 3 decades in the Hadassah Community Health Center in Jerusalem, Israel. Integration of public health responsibility with individual-based clinical management of patients formed the cornerstone of the COPC approach. A family medicine practice and a mother and child preventive service provided the frameworks for this development. The health needs of the community were assessed, priorities determined, and intervention programs developed and implemented on the basis of detailed analysis of the factors responsible for defined health states. Ongoing health surveillance facilitated evaluation, and the effectiveness of interventions in different population groups was illustrated. The center's international COPC involvement has had effects on primary health care policy worldwide.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to systematically review the evidence for population-based mammography as applied to a Chinese population. Methods. Primary reports for meta-analysis were identified by a search of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library. Outcome measures included breast cancer-related mortality, the number needed to be screened to prevent 1 death, and the positive predictive value of mammography. Results. Pooled relative risk for breast cancer-related death in the screened group was 0.80 (95% confidence interval=0.71, 0.90). Applied to Hong Kong, this figure translates into a number needed to screen of 1302 healthy women screened annually for 10 years to prevent 1 death. Conclusions. Evidence is insufficient to justify population-based breast cancer screening by mammography for women in Hong Kong and other Asian populations with low breast cancer prevalence.

Abstract: Objectives. We studied the association between the local food environment and residents' report of recommended dietary intake. Methods. Recommended intakes of foods and nutrients for 10623 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities participants were estimated from food frequency questionnaires. Supermarkets, grocery stores, and full-service and fast-food restaurants were geocoded to census tracts. Results. Black Americans' fruit and vegetable intake increased by 32% for each additional supermarket in the census tract (relative risk [RR] = 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08, 1.60). White Americans' fruit and vegetable intake increased by 11% with the presence of 1 or more supermarket (RR = 1.11; 95% CI = 0.93, 1.32). Conclusions. These findings suggest the local food environment is associated with residents' recommended diets.

Abstract: The Russian health care system historically has not relied on medical evidence to guide practice, uses centralized management, and is burdened by overspecialization. In 1999, a community health partnership was established between Sarov, Russia, and Los Alamos, NM, 2 cities linked by their nuclear weapons histories. Health problems addressed include asthma and diabetes, pediatric dental caries, low prevalence of breastfeeding, and adolescent drug abuse and sexually transmitted diseases. A community-oriented primary care approach was adopted that includes (1) implementing a "train the trainers" strategy to educate health professionals and lay people, (2) adapting established clinical practice guidelines based on local resources, (3) restricting use of expensive or limited resources, and (4) securing commitments from local government for expendable supplies and medications.

This study was undertaken to assess a 28-day detention and treatment program's effect, in a multiethnic county with high rates of alcohol-related arrests and crashes, on first-time offenders sentenced for driving while impaired (DWI). Methods. We used comparison of baseline characteristics, survival curves of subsequent arrest, and Cox proportional hazards regression to examine probability of rearrest of those sentenced and those not sentenced to the program. Results. Probability of not being rearrested was significantly higher for the treatment group after adjustment for covariates. At 5 years, probability of not being rearrested for the treatment vs the nontreatment group was 76.6% vs 59.9%. Conclusions. Results suggest that this county's program has significantly affected rearrest rates for Native Americans, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic Whites.

We compared mortality rates between New York and California counties in the lowest and highest quartiles of socioeconomic status (SES), assessed rate variability between counties for various outcomes, and examined correlations between outcomes' sensitivity to SES and their variability. Results. Outcomes with mortality rates that differed most by county SES were among those whose variability across counties was high (e.g., AIDS, homicide, cirrhosis). Lower-SES counties manifested greater variability among outcome measures. Conclusions. Differences in health outcome variability reflect differences in SES impact on health. Health variability at the ecological level might reflect the impact of stressors on vulnerable populations.

Abstract: Community-oriented primary care (COPC) originated in South Africa during the 1940s and 1950s, where it served to inform local church-based and nongovernmental organization-based initiatives during the apartheid years. During the 1990s, COPC played an inspirational role in the process of national health policy formulation. Yet COPC's contribution to current health practice remains more symbolic than substantive. Despite a policy framework that favors the widespread introduction of COPC, various political, structural, managerial, and human resource obstacles constrain its effective implementation. Notwithstanding a rapidly changing health care environment and well-established health transition from infections and nutritional disorders to non-communicable diseases and injury, COPC and its variants remain abidingly relevant to South Africa's - and Africa's - health care reality.

Abstract: Objectives. This study sought to examine the effects of government policies and neighborhood characteristics on adolescent female sexual behavior to better inform future public policy decisions. Methods. Using a bivariate probit model and National Survey of Family Growth data on women aged 15 through 19 years, we estimated the probabilities of their being sexually active and, if sexually active, of their using contraceptives. Results. Variables measuring the cost of obtaining an abortion are not good predictors of sexual activity or contraceptive use. However, the relationship between family planning availability and contraceptive use is statistically significant at conventional levels. Conclusions. Policymakers seem to have little leverage with regard to influencing the decision to become sexually active, although increased access to family planning services may encourage responsible contraceptive behavior. Neighborhood context is an important determinant of adolescent female sexual behavior.

Abstract: Objectives. We investigated the relationship between Helicobacterpylori infection and abnormal periodontal conditions. Methods. Data from the first phase of the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used. A total of 4504 participants aged 20 to 59 years who completed a periodontal examination and tested positive for H. pylori antibodies were examined. Results. Periodontal pockets with a depth of 5 mm or more were associated with increased odds of H. pylori seropositivity (odds ratio [OR]= 1.47; 95% confidence interval [Cl]= 1.12, 1.94) after adjustment for sociodemographic factors. This association is comparable to the independent effects of poverty on H. pylori OR= 1.54; 95% CI = 1.10, 2.16). Conclusions. Poor periodontal health, characterized by advanced periodontal pockets, may be associated with H. pylori infection in adults, independent of poverty status.

Abstract: The UK National Health Service has long delivered public health programs through primary care. However, attempts to promote Sidney Kark's model of community-oriented primary care (COPC), based on general practice populations, have made only limited headway. Recent policy developments give COPC new resonance. Currently, primary care trusts are assuming responsibility for improving the health of the populations they serve, and personal medical service pilots are tailoring primary care to local needs under local contracts. COPC has yielded training packages and frameworks that can assist these new organizations in developing public health skills and understanding among a wide range of primary care professionals.

Abstract: Objectives. This Seattle project measured sexual health services provided to 1112 Medicaid managed care enrollees aged 14 to 18 years. Methods. Three health maintenance organizations (HMOs) that provide Medicaid services for a capitated rate agreed to participate. These included a non-profit staff-model HMO, a for-profit independent practice association (IPA), and a non-profit alliance of community clinics. Analyses used health maintenance organizations' administrative data, chart reviews, and Medicaid encounter data. Results. Health maintenance organizations provided primary care to 54% and well care to 20% of Medicaid enrollees. Girls were more likely than boys to have their sexual history taken or to be given condom counseling. Only 27% of sexually active girls were tested for chlamydia, with significantly lower rates of testing among those who spoke English as a second language. The nonprofit staff-model plan outperformed the for-profit independent practice association on most measures. Conclusions. Substantial room for improvement exists in sexual health services delivery to adolescent Medicaid managed care enrollees.

Abstract: Objectives. This study determined the extent to which churches in the South were providing mental health and social services to congregations and had established linkages with formal systems of care. Methods. A computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) survey was conducted with pastors from 269 Southern churches. Results. Black churches reported providing many more services than did White churches, regardless of urban or rural location. Few links between churches and formal provider systems were found, irrespective of the location - urban or rural - or racial composition of the churches. Conclusions. Results are discussed in terms of the potential for linking faith communities and formal systems of care, given the centrality of the Black church in historical context.

Abstract: Objectives. This study sought to characterize the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) among persons with diabetes mellitus residing in the United States. Methods. Data from a 1997-1998 national survey (n=2055) on CAM use were examined. Results. Ninety-five respondents reported having diabetes, of whom 57% reported CAM use in the past year; fewer respondents (35%) reported use specifically for diabetes. Therapies used for diabetes included solitary prayer/spiritual practices (28%), herbal remedies (7%), commercial diets (6%), and folk remedies (3%). Excluding solitary prayer, only 20% of respondents used CAM to treat diabetes. Conclusions. The prevalence of CAM therapy use among persons with diabetes is comparable to that among the general population. Use of CAM therapies specifically to treat diabetes, however, is much less common.

Pages: 1579-1581
Abstract: Scientific research is particularly important as a guide to health care policy regarding the "integration" of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) into conventional medical practices. A spectrum of possibilities has emerged around the question of balancing integration toward complementary vs alternative usages. Although scientific research can guide policies and practices, it has become subject to greater scrutiny and linked to differences on policy issues. Using CAM cancer therapies as a case study, this commentary explores relationships between methodology and policy regarding the integration of CAM therapies.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the effect of acupuncture alone and in combination with education on smoking cessation and cigarette consumption. Methods. We prospectively studied 141 adults in a quasi-factorial design using acupuncture, sham acupuncture, and education. Results. All groups showed significant reductions in smoking and posttreatment cigarette consumption, with the combined acupuncture-education group showing the greatest effect from treatment. The trend continued in follow-up; however, significant differences were not maintained. Greater pack-year history (i.e. the number of years smoking multiplied by baseline number of cigarettes smoked per year, divided by 20 cigarettes per pack) negatively correlated with treatment effect. Trend analysis suggested 20 pack-years as the cutoff point for this correlation. Conclusions. Acupuncture and education, alone and in combination, significantly reduce smoking; however, combined they show a significantly greater effect, as seen in subjects with a greater pack-year history.

Author-Name: De Rios, M.D.
Year: 2002
Volume: 92
Issue: 10

Abstract: The author, a medical anthropologist and licensed psychotherapist, draws on a database of 700 Latino immigrant families whom she has treated to demonstrate concepts and techniques of psychotherapeutic intervention that are derived from shamanic roots in the immigrant's original culture. Congruences may exist between the shamanic techniques of the coastal and Amazonian regions of Peru and 3 Western psychotherapy techniques - hypnosis, behavior modification, and cognitive restructuring. By using historic links with Hispanic culture and the techniques discussed in the commentary, psychotherapists can acquire cultural competence that will enable them to effectively reduce mental illness symptoms presented by US Latino immigrants in clinical practice.

Abstract: Traditional medicine (a term used here to denote the indigenous health traditions of the world) and complementary and alternative medicine (T/CAM) have, in the past 10 years, claimed an increasing share of the public's awareness and the agenda of medical researchers. Studies have documented that about half the population of many industrialized countries now use T/CAM, and the proportion is as high as 80% in many developing countries. Most research has focused on clinical and experimental medicine (safety, efficacy, and mechanism of action) and regulatory issues, to the general neglect of public health dimensions. Public health research must consider social, cultural, political, and economic contexts to maximize the contribution of T/CAM to health care systems globally.

Abstract: Objectives. This meta-analysis was conducted to examine the effectiveness of Chinese herbal medicine (either alone or with interferon alfa) in treating chronic hepatitis B. Methods. We searched the TCMLARS, AMED, CISCOM, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Collaboration databases and then hand-searched the articles' bibliographies. Results. Chinese herbal medicine significantly increased seroreversion of HBsAg and was equivalent to interferon alfa in seroreversion of HBeAg and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA; Chinese herbal medicine combined with interferon alfa significantly increased seroreversion of HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA. The Chinese herbal medicine active component bufotoxin combined with interferon alfa significantly increased HBeAg and HBV DNA seroreversion. The Chinese herbal medicine active component kurorinone was equivalent to interferon alfa in seroreversion of HBeAg and HBV DNA. Conclusions. Although the quality of existing studies was poor, these data suggest that further trials of Chinese Herbal Medicine and interferon in chronic hepatitis B infection are justified.

Abstract: Objectives. The effect of massage therapy on chronic nonmigraine headache was investigated. Methods. Chronic tension headache sufferers received structured massage therapy treatment directed toward neck and shoulder muscles. Headache frequency, duration, and intensity were recorded and compared with baseline measures. Results. Compared with baseline values, headache frequency was significantly reduced within the first week of the massage protocol. The reduction of headache frequency continued for the remainder of the study (P=.009). The duration of headaches tended to decrease during the massage treatment period (P=.058). Headache intensity was unaffected by massage (P=.19). Conclusions. The muscle-specific massage therapy technique used in this study has the potential to be a functional, nonpharmacological intervention for reducing the incidence of chronic tension headache.

Abstract: Patients will always have access to a variety of possibly effective, but unproved, therapies directed at maintaining health or treating illness. And there will always be complex, potentially therapeutic regimens that cannot be adequately tested for financial, ethical, or methodological reasons. Furthermore, even after adequate study of a given regimen, there will always be the fundamental uncertainty of medical practice: the fact that epidemiological research produces probabilistic results that cannot predict with certainty the best treatment for the single unique patient before us. The exploration of complementary and alternative medicine topics in the medical school curriculum helps to elucidate the complex and uncertain nature of medical practice, sharpens skills for clinical decisionmaking, increases cultural sensitivity, and provides ideas for future research.

Volume: 92

Abstract: Objectives. To explore whether treatment outcomes are associated with a patient's degree of general hopefulness, expectations regarding treatment, attributions of health status, beliefs about mind-body dualism, and patient-provider relationship factors, I studied acupuncture patients' goal attainment. Methods. Sixty-two acupuncture patients were interviewed before and after acupuncture regarding goal attainment, mind-body beliefs, hopefulness, and attributions of health status. Demographics, acupuncture treatment, and health care usage information was also collected. Acupuncturists provided 3 months of treatment. Results. Patients reported treatment goal attainment from acupuncture. Their perceived outcomes were not associated with previous treatment, patient demographics, or the expected and actual numbers of needle insertion. Successful outcomes were related positively to number of different CAM treatments used in the past year but negatively to patients' expectations and the "Powerful Others" health locus of control dimension. Conclusions. Perceived acupuncture outcomes seem not to be related to placebo effects and patient expectations, but rather to client-practitioner relationship factors.

Abstract: Objectives. This study was undertaken to establish the health status of users of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) services in England. Methods. A postal questionnaire (response rate: 64%) covering long-standing illness, use of conventional medical and CAM services, and the United Kingdom Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) was sent to more than 14000 adults in 4 counties. Results. Sixty percent of CAM users reported having a chronic illness or disability; back pain and bowel problems were the conditions most commonly reported. Regardless of whether chronic illness was reported, CAM users reported poorer health than nonusers, particularly in the dimensions of pain and physical disability, and made more visits to general practitioners. Conclusions. In England, users of CAM services have poorer physical health than nonusers and make more frequent use of conventional medical services.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the difference in satisfaction between patients assigned to chiropractic vs medical care for treatment of low back pain in a managed care organization. Methods. Satisfaction scores (on a 10-50 scale) after 4 weeks of follow-up were compared among 672 patients randomized to receive medical or chiropractic care. Results. The mean satisfaction score for chiropractic patients was greater than the score for medical patients (crude difference=5.5; 95% confidence interval=4.5, 6.5). Self-care advice and explanation of treatment predicted satisfaction and reduced the estimated difference between chiropractic and medical patients' satisfaction. Conclusions. Communication of advice and information to patients with low back pain increases their satisfaction with providers and accounts for much of the difference between chiropractic and medical patients' satisfaction.

If comprehensive health care is to be offered, coordination of services between health and mental health practitioners is needed. Gathering together to support each other has been a traditional custom for Native women. An integrated health care model is discussed that offers Native women an opportunity to deal with the challenge of mental health and health issues through traditional activities, enhancing their physical and spiritual health and receiving education while creating an atmosphere of empowerment and mutual support.

Abstract: Objectives. The purpose of this study was to assess changes in health insurance and food assistance enrollment following passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. Methods. Extant data sources were used to calculate changes in Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Medicaid, and Food Stamp program enrollment in medically underserved Manhattan communities after 1996. Results. Dramatic declines in TANF enrollment were accompanied by declines in Food Stamp program enrollment and a deceleration in Medicaid enrollment among several communities. Conclusions. As the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act comes up for reauthorization later in 2002, policymakers should revise legislation so that needy families do not lose health insurance or food assistance support.

Abstract: Objectives. This study evaluated the association of chronic child illness with parental employment among individuals who have had contact with the welfare system. Methods. Parents of children with chronic illnesses were interviewed. Results. Current and former welfare recipients and welfare applicants were more likely than those with no contact with the welfare system to report that their children's illnesses adversely affected their employment. Logistic regression analyses showed that current and former receipt of welfare, pending welfare application, and high rates of child health care use were predictors of unemployment. Conclusions. Welfare recipients and applicants with chronically ill children face substantial barriers to employment, including high child health care use rates and missed work. The welfare reform reauthorization scheduled to occur later in 2002 should address the implications of chronic child illness for parental employment.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the impact of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on health status and work disability. Methods. We used data from a population-based sample of 3805 California adults. Results. Compared with adults with no chronic health conditions, adults with COPD or asthma had a greater risk of self-reported diminished general health (odds ratio [OR]=10.95; 95% confidence interval [CI]=6.31, 19.0 and OR=3.92; 95% CI=2.31, 6.65, respectively). Respondents with COPD or asthma also had worse mental health status, as indicated by a greater risk of depressive symptoms (OR=10.05; 95% CI=5.29, 19.08 and OR=2.59; 95% CI=1.33, 5.04). COPD was associated with reduced current employment (OR=0.41; 95% CI=0.24, 0.71). Conclusions. Asthma and COPD are associated with poor health status and greater work disability.

Abstract: Objectives. This study assessed chronic child illness among recipients of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits and poor families not receiving benefits. Methods. Data from the 1998 National Health Interview Survey were used to examine chronic child illness, enrollment in TANF, health insurance status, and selected access indicators. Results. One quarter of TANF-enrolled children had chronic illnesses. Unenrolled children were 3 times as likely as TANF-enrolled children to be uninsured. Among the chronically ill, 31.7% of unenrolled and 14.3% of enrolled children experienced gaps in insurance coverage that were associated with access barriers. Conclusions. Welfare policies should consider the effects of chronic illness and gaps in insurance coverage on the health of poor children.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the prevalence and correlates of violent behavior by individuals with severe mental illness. Methods. Participants (N = 802) were adults with psychotic or major mood disorders receiving inpatient or outpatient services in public mental health systems in 4 states. Results. The 1-year prevalence of serious assaultive behavior was 13%. Three variables-past violent victimization, violence in the surrounding environment, and substance abuse-showed a cumulative association with risk of violent behavior. Conclusions. Violence among individuals with severe mental illness is related to multiple variables with compounded effects over the life span. Interventions to reduce the risk of violence need to be targeted to specific subgroups with different clusters of problems related to violent behavior.

Abstract: Objectives. We sought to provide a national profile of rural and urban American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) maternal and infant health. Methods. In this cross-sectional study of all 1989-1991 singleton AI/AN births to US residents, we compared receipt of an inadequate pattern of prenatal care, low birthweight (<2500 g), infant mortality, and cause of death for US rural and urban AI/AN and non-AI/AN populations. Results. Receipt of an inadequate pattern of prenatal care was significantly higher for rural than for urban mothers of AI/AN infants (18.1% vs 14.4%, P≤.001); rates for both groups were over twice that for Whites (6.8%). AI/AN postneonatal death rates (rural=6.7 per 1000; urban=5.4 per 1000) were more than twice that of Whites (2.6 per 1000). Conclusions. Preventable disparities between AI/ANs and Whites in maternal and infant health status persist.

Abstract: Objectives. This study evaluated the relationships between health insurance and welfare status and the health and medical care of children with asthma. Methods. Parents of children with asthma aged 2 to 12 years were interviewed at 6 urban clinical sites and 2 welfare offices. Results. Children whose families had applied for but were denied welfare had more asthma symptoms than did children whose families had had no contact with the welfare system. Poorer mental health in parents was associated with more asthma symptoms and higher rates of health care use in their children. Parents of uninsured and transiently insured children identified more barriers to health care than did parents whose children were insured. Conclusions. Children whose families have applied for welfare and children who are uninsured are at high risk medically and may require additional services to improve health outcomes.

American Indian and Alaska Native children (< 15 years), adolescents (15-19 years), and young adults (20-34 years) with diabetes were identified from the Indian Health Service (IHS) outpatient database. The population living within IHS contract health service delivery areas was determined from census data. Results. From 1990 to 1998, the total number of young American Indians and Alaska Natives with diagnosed diabetes increased by 71% (4534 to 7736); prevalence increased by 46% (6.4 per 1000 to 9.3 per 1000 population). Increases in prevalence were greater among adolescents and among young men. Conclusions. Diabetes should be considered a major public health problem among young American Indians and Alaska Natives.

Abstract: Indoor nonindustrial work environments were designated a priority research area through the nationwide stakeholder process that created the National Occupational Research Agenda. A multidisciplinary research team used member consensus and quantitative estimates, with extensive external review, to develop a specific research agenda. The team outlined the following priority research topics: building-influenced communicable respiratory infections, building-related asthma/allergic diseases, and nonspecific building-related symptoms; indoor environmental science; and methods for increasing implementation of healthful building practices. Available data suggest that improving building environments may result in health benefits for more than 15 million of the 89 million US indoor workers, with estimated economic benefits of $5 to $75 billion annually. Research on these topics, requiring new collaborations and resources, offers enormous potential health and economic returns.

Abstract: Occupational health surveillance data are key to effective intervention, However, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics survey significantly underestimates the incidence of work-related injuries and illnesses. Researchers supplement these statistics with data from other systems not designed for surveillance. The authors apply the filter model of Webb et al. to underreporting by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, workers' compensation wage-replacement documents, physician reporting systems, and medical records of treatment charged to workers' compensation. Mechanisms are described for the loss of cases at successive steps of documentation. Empirical findings indicate that workers repeatedly risk adverse consequences for attempting to complete these steps, while systems for ensuring their completion are weak or absent.

Abstract: Objectives. Taiwan's National Health Insurance Program (NHI) was implemented on March 1, 1995. This study analyzed the influences of the Case Payment method of reimbursement for inpatient care and of physician financial incentives on a woman's choice for primary cesarean delivery. Methods. Logistic regressions were used to analyze 11788 first-time deliveries in a nonprofit hospital system between March 1, 1994, and February 29, 1996. Results. After implementation of the NHI's Case Payment scheme, the likelihood that a woman would choose primary cesarean delivery, increased by four to five times compared with the choice behavior of uninsured individuals prior to NHI (P<.0001). Conclusion. Out-of-pocket payment discourages the selection of primary cesarean delivery. No robust statistics were found relating physician financial incentives to delivery choice.

Abstract: Objectives. This study assessed the effectiveness of an intervention to reduce wood dust, a carcinogen, by approximately 26% in small woodworking businesses. Methods. We randomized 48 businesses to an intervention (written recommendations, technical assistance, and worker training) or comparison (written recommendations alone) condition. Changes from baseline in dust concentration, dust control methods, and worker behavior were compared between the groups 1 year later. Results. At follow-up, workers in intervention relative to comparison businesses reported greater awareness, increases in stage of readiness, and behavioral changes consistent with dust control. The median dust concentration change in the intervention group from baseline to follow-up was 10.4% (95% confidence interval =-28.8%, 12.7%) lower than the change in comparison businesses. Conclusions. We attribute the smaller-than-expected reduction in wood dust to the challenge of conducting rigorous intervention effectiveness research in occupational settings.

Abstract: American Indians and Alaska Natives continue to experience significant disparities in health status compared with the US general population and now are facing the new challenges of rising rates of chronic diseases. The Indian health system continues to try to meet the federal trust responsibility to provide health care for American Indians and Alaska Natives despite significant shortfalls in funding, resources, and staff. New approaches to these Indian health challenges, including a greater focus on public health, community-based interventions, and tribal management of health programs, provide hope that the health of Indian communities will improve in the near future.

Abstract: Objectives. This study investigated whether health problems among poor mothers of chronically ill children affect their ability to obtain and maintain employment. Methods. Mothers of children with chronic illnesses were surveyed at clinical and welfare agency sites in San Antonio, Tex. Results. There were distinct health differences according to mothers' TANF and employment status. Mothers without TANF experience reported better physical and mental health and less domestic violence and substance use than did those who had TANF experience. Those not currently working had higher rates of physical and mental health problems. Conclusions. Poor maternal health is associated with need for cash assistance and health insurance. Policymakers must recognize that social policies promoting employment will fail if they do not address the health needs of poor women and children.

Abstract: From World War II until 1971, the government was the sole purchaser of uranium ore in the United States. Uranium mining occurred mostly in the southwestern United States and drew many Native Americans and others into work in the mines and mills. Despite a long and well-developed understanding, based on the European experience earlier in the century, that uranium mining led to high rates of lung cancer, few protections were provided for US miners before 1962 and their adoption after that time was slow and incomplete. The resulting high rates of illness among miners led in 1990 to passage of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined whether marital status is associated with suicide rates among various age, sex, and racial groups, in particular with widowhood among young adults of both sexes. Methods. US national suicide mortality data were compiled for the years 1991-1996, and suicide rates were broken down by race, 5-year age groups, sex, and marital status. Results. Data on suicide rates indicated an approximately 17-fold increase among young widowed White men (aged 20-34 years), a 9-fold increase among young widowed African American men, and lesser increases among young widowed White women compared with their married counterparts. Conclusions. National data suggest that as many as 1 in 400 White and African American widowed men aged 20-35 years will die by suicide in any given year (compared with 1 in 9000 married men in the general population).

Abstract: Objectives. This article explores the social context of the migration-related HIV epidemic in western Mexico. Methods. Data collection involved life histories and participant observation with migrant women in Atlanta and their sisters or sisters-in-law in Mexico. Results. Both younger and older women acknowledged that migrant men's sexual behavior may expose them to HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. Younger Mexican women in both communities expressed a marital ideal characterized by mutual intimacy, communication, joint decisionmaking, and sexual pleasure, but not by willingness to use condoms as an HIV prevention strategy. Conclusions. Migrant Mexican women's commitment to an illusion of fidelity will hinder HIV prevention initiatives targeted toward them. Furthermore, the changing meanings of marital sex may make it harder to convince young couples to use condoms as an HIV prevention strategy. If the chain of heterosexual marital HIV transmission is to be interrupted in this community, prevention programs must target men.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the association between health insurance coverage, medical care use, limitations in activities of daily living, and mortality among older Mexican-origin individuals. Methods. We analyzed longitudinal data from the Hispanic Established Populations for Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (H-EPESE). Results. The uninsured tend to be younger, female, poor, and foreign born. They report fewer health care visits, are less likely to have a usual source of care, and more often receive care in Mexico. Conversely, those with private health insurance are economically better off and use more health care services. Over time, the data reveal substantial changes in type of insurance coverage. Conclusions. The data reveal serious vulnerabilities among older Mexican Americans that result from a lack of private Medigap supplemental coverage.

Abstract: Objectives. Experiences of partner violence were compared between HIV-positive and HIV-negative women. Methods. Of 340 women enrolled, 245 (72%) were followed and interviewed 3 months after HIV testing to estimate the prevalence and identify the correlates of violence. Results. The odds of reporting at least 1 violent event was significantly higher among HIV-positive women than among HIV-negative women (physical violence odds ratio [OR]=2.63; 95% confidence interval [Cl]=1.23, 5.63; sexual violence OR=2.39; 95% Cl=1.21, 4.73). Odds of reporting partner violence was 10 times higher among younger (<30 years) HIV-positive women than among younger HIV-negative women (OR=9.99; 95% Cl=2,67, 37.37). Conclusions. Violence is a risk factor for HIV infection that must be addressed through multilevel prevention approaches.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the usefulness of computer-assisted active surveillance in identifying maternal deaths in New York City. Methods. Computerized searches of hospital discharge and autopsy record databases were conducted for maternal deaths occurring in 1997. Results. Active surveillance revealed 14 new maternal deaths not previously reported, an 88% increase. Nine of these deaths were found through the hospital discharge database search. I was found through the autopsy record search, and 4 were found in both searches. Overall maternal mortality ratios associated with active surveillance and routine surveillance were 24.3 and 13.0 deaths per 100000 live births, respectively. Conclusions. Active surveillance of maternal mortality is useful in identifying new maternal deaths. Existing databases can be used relatively easily to augment routine surveillance of maternal mortality.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the association between caregiving for disabled or ill family members, estimated to occur in more than 22 million US households, and change in mental health. Methods. We assessed 4-year change in mental health among 37 742 Nurses' Health Study participants with the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36. Results. Women who provided 36 or more weekly hours of care to a disabled spouse were almost 6 times more likely than noncaregivers to experience depressive or anxious symptoms (multivariate odds ratio [OR] = 5.6; 95% confidence interval [Cl] = 3.8, 8.3). Caring for a disabled or ill parent (≳36 weekly hours) was associated with a less dramatic elevation in depressive or anxious symptoms (multivariate OR=2.0; 95% Cl = 0.9, 4.3). Conclusions. In this population, caregiving was associated with increased risk of depressive or anxious symptoms.

Abstract: Objectives. This study analyzed whether inadequate functional health literacy is an independent risk factor for hospital admission. Methods. We studied a prospective cohort of 3260 Medicare managed care enrollees. Results. Of the participants, 29.5% were hospitalized. The crude relative risk (RR) of hospitalization was higher for individuals with inadequate literacy (n=800; RR= 1.43; 95% confidence interval [Cl]=1.24, 1.65) and marginal literacy (n=366; RR=1.33; 95% Cl=1.09, 1.61) than for those with adequate literacy (n=2094). In multivariate analysis, the adjusted relative risk of hospital admission was 1.29 (95% Cl=1.07, 1.55) for individuals with inadequate literacy and 1.21 (95% Cl=0.97, 1.50) for those with marginal literacy. Conclusions. Inadequate literacy was an independent risk factor for hospital admission among elderly managed care enrollees.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined whether the social gradient for measures of morbidity is comparable in English and French public employees and investigated risk factors that may explain this gradient. Methods. This longitudinal study of 2 occupational cohorts-5825 London civil servants and 6818 French office-based employees-used 2 health outcomes: long spells of sickness absence during a 4-year follow-up and self-reported health. Results. Strong social gradients in health were observed in both cohorts. Health behaviors showed different relations with socioeconomic position in the 2 samples. Psychosocial work characteristics showed strong gradients in both cohorts, Cohort-specific significant risk factors explained between 12% and 56% of the gradient in sickness absence and self-reported health. Conclusions. Our cross-cultural comparison suggests that some common susceptibility may underlie the social gradient in health and disease, which explains why inequalities occur in cultures with different patterns of morbidity and mortality.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined whether adolescents' recall of antidrug advertising is associated with a decreased probability of using illicit drugs and, given drug use, a reduced volume of use. Methods. A behavioral economic model of influences on drug consumption was developed with survey data from a nationally representative sample of adolescents to determine the incremental impact of antidrug advertising. Results. The findings provided evidence that recall of antidrug advertising was associated with a lower probability of marijuana and cocaine/crack use. Recall of such advertising was not associated with the decision of how much marijuana or cocaine/crack to use. Results suggest that individuals predisposed to try marijuana are also predisposed to try cocaine/crack. Conclusions. The present results provide support for the effectiveness of antidrug advertising programs.

Abstract: Objectives. In this study, we examined racial separation in long-term care. Methods. We used a survey of a stratified sample of 181 residential care/assisted living (RC/AL) facilities and 39 nursing homes in 4 states. Results. Most African Americans resided in nursing homes and smaller RC/AL facilities and tended to be concentrated in a few predominantly African American facilities, whereas the vast majority of Whites resided in predominantly White facilities. Facilities housing African Americans tended to be located in rural, nonpoor, African American communities, to admit individuals with mental retardation and difficulty in ambulating, and to have lower ratings of cleanliness/maintenance and lighting. Conclusions. These racial disparities may result from economic factors, exclusionary practices, or resident choice. Whether separation relates to inequities in care is undetermined.

Abstract: Objectives. This study investigated socioeconomic predictors of obesity in men and women. Methods. Data from the 1996 Health Survey for England were used to compare odds ratios for obesity by education, occupation, and 2 economic markers after control for age, marital status, and ethnicity. Results. Obesity risk was greater among men and women with fewer years of education and poorer economic circumstances and among women, but not men, of lower occupational status. Conclusions. Higher educational attainment and higher socioeconomic status were associated with a lower risk of obesity in both men and women, whereas higher occupational status was associated with a lower risk only for women. The implications of these findings for understanding causes and prevention of obesity are discussed.

Abstract: In 1999, a cluster of encephalitis cases was detected in New York City. The city applied larvicide to standing water and aerially sprayed pesticides to control adult mosquitoes. The causative agent was West Nile virus, a type of encephalitis that had never before been transmitted in the western hemisphere. This experience offers many lessons for the practitioners of public health and of public health law. A public health infrastructure that does not lose sight of the old threats must be maintained. The public health and environmental governmental establishments must work together. Law is closely intertwined with policy and programmatic initiatives and can facilitate a better public health outcome.

Abstract: Objectives. We estimated total life expectancy and driving life expectancy of US drivers aged 70 years and older. Methods. Life table methods were applied to 4699 elderly persons who were driving in 1993 and reassessed in a 1995 survey. Results. Drivers aged 70 to 74 years had a driving life expectancy of approximately 11 years. A higher risk of mortality among men as a cause of driving cessation offset a higher risk of driving cessation not related to mortality among women that resulted in similar driving life expectancies. Conclusions. Nationwide, many elderly drivers quit driving each year and must seek alternative sources of transportation. Because of differences in life expectancy, women require more years of support for transportation, on average, than men after age 70.

Abstract: Objectives. This study sought to determine the impact of Maryland's all-rider motorcycle helmet law (enacted on October 1, 1992) on preventing deaths and traumatic brain injuries among motorcyclists. Methods. Statewide motorcyclist fatalities occurring during seasonally comparable 33-month periods immediately preceding and following enactment of the law were compared. Results. The motorcyclist fatality rate dropped from 10.3 per 10 000 registered motorcycles prelaw to 4.5 postlaw despite almost identical numbers of registered motorcycles. Motorcyclists wearing helmets had a lower risk of traumatic brain injury than those not wearing helmets (odds ratio=0.31, 95% confidence interval =0.14, 0.68). Conclusions. Maryland's controversial motorcycle helmet law appears to be an effective public health policy and may be responsible for saving many lives.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the impact of drug coverage generosity on older persons' prescription events (fills) and expenditures. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted of 6237 older persons from the 1995 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. Dependent variables were per capita prescription events and expenditures. Independent variables were insurance type and drug coverage generosity. Control variables included sociodemographic and health status factors. Results. Regardless of insurance type, per capita prescription events increased as drug coverage generosity improved and then decreased at the most generous level. Per capita prescription expenditures increased as generosity improved; with generous prescription coverage, prescription expenditures were approximately 3 times those with Medicare only. Conclusions. Even when factors that affect drug use and insurance selection are controlled, prescription coverage generosity influences prescription use.

Abstract: Objectives. This study sought to demonstrate life-course influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods. Data were derived from a prospective observational study in which the main outcome measure was death resulting from CVD. Results. Combining 4 socioeconomic and behavioral risk indicators into a measure of life-course exposure produced 5 groups whose relative risks of CVD mortality ranged from 1.00 (the group with the most favorable life-course exposures) to 4.55 (the group with the least favorable life-course exposures). If the entire study population had had the CVD mortality risk of the subsample with the most favorable risk factor profile, approximately two thirds of cardiovascular deaths would not have occurred. Conclusions. CVD risk is influenced in a cumulative fashion by socioeconomic and behavioral factors acting throughout the life course.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the persistence and comorbidity of women's physical and mental health conditions after pregnancy and the association of these conditions with child outcomes. Methods. A national cohort of women who recently gave birth were surveyed in 1988 and again in 1991, We examined longitudinal data on maternal poor physical health, depressive symptoms, and smoking, and maternal report of child outcomes (at age 3 years). Results. Women's poor physical health and smoking had strong, graded associations with children's physical health and behavior problems, whereas women's depressive symptoms were associated with children's delayed language and behavior problems. Conclusions. Substantial persistence and comorbidity of women's health conditions exist after pregnancy with adverse effects on early child outcomes. Child health professionals should support services and policies that promote women's health outside the context of pregnancy.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts and psychosocial correlates in a large population-based sample of men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods. A telephone probability sample of US urban MSM (n=2881) were interviewed between November 1996 and February 1998. Results. Twenty-one percent had made a suicide plan; 12% had attempted suicide (almost half of those 12% were multiple attempters). Most who attempted suicide made their first attempt before age 25. Although prevalence of parasuicide (i.e., attempted suicide) has remained constant across birth cohorts, mean age at initial attempts has declined. Conclusions. MSM are at elevated risk for suicide attempts, with such risk clustered earlier in life. Some risk factors were specific to being gay or bisexual in a hostile environment.

Abstract: Objectives. We studied the effects of twins and triplets on perinatal health indicators in the overall population in the 1980s and 1990s in Canada, England and Wales, France, and the United States. Methods. Data were derived mostly from live birth registration. We used rates, relative risks, and population attributable risks for twins and triplets separately. Results. In each country, the increase in multiple births, and the increase in preterm delivery among multiple births, contributed almost equally to the rise in or stabilization of the overall rates of preterm delivery. Twins contributed a much larger proportion of the preterm deliveries and low-birthweight newborns than did triplets. Conclusions. Twins have a major population-based impact on the trends of perinatal health indicators.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the methodology of epidemiological studies that suggest use of topical sunscreen preparations is associated with increased risk of malignant melanoma. Methods. We pooled data from observational studies using a general variance-based meta-analytic method that employed confidence intervals (previously described), The outcome of interest was a summary relative risk (RR) reflecting the risk of melanoma associated with sunscreen use versus nonuse. Sensitivity analyses were performed when necessary to explain any observed statistical heterogeneity. Results. Combining studies that used nonheterogeneous data yielded a summary RR of 1.01, indicating no association between sunscreen use and development of malignant melanoma. Conclusions. The available epidemiological data do not support the existence of a relationship between topical sunscreen use and an increased risk of cutaneous malignant melanoma.

Title: Nontherapeutic research with children: Grimes v Kennedy Krieger Institute

Volume: 92
Issue: 7
Pages: 1070-1073
Abstract: Research with young children raises difficult issues of law and ethics. A recent Maryland case, Grimes v Kennedy Krieger Institute, Inc, appears to impose restrictive rules on research with children when the subjects are put at risk but cannot derive direct benefit from their involvement in the research project. This case exemplifies the tension that exists between the goal of science to increase knowledge and the protection of the rights and welfare of nonconsenting research subjects. While some language in the opinion may be difficult to understand or apply, for the most part the case reflects the problems other courts and ethicists have had in delineating the role of children in "nontherapeutic" research.

Abstract: The use of restraints in motor vehicles is less common in minority and low-income populations than in the general population. A preliminary survey of Hispanic preschool-aged children in west Dallas, Texas, conducted in 1997 showed much lower child restraint use (19% of those surveyed) than among preschool children of all races in the rest of the city (62%). Because there are few reports of successful programs to increase child restraint use among Hispanics, we undertook to implement and evaluate such a program. The program was conducted by bilingual staff and was tailored for this community. It was successful in increasing both child restraint use and driver seat belt use.

Abstract: Objectives. This study compared factors known or hypothesized to influence depressive symptomatology in a community sample of lesbians and heterosexual women. Methods. Data were collected in a multisite survey of lesbians' physical and mental health. Results. Findings confirmed earlier reports suggesting that traumatic life events such as physical and sexual abuse, and individual traits and coping styles are risk factors for depressive distress. However, findings of higher rates of suicidal behavior and of several risk factors for depressive distress among lesbians suggest that risk for depression may differ among lesbians and heterosexual women. Conclusions. Sexual orientation may represent an important but poorly understood risk factor for depressive distress as well as suicidal ideation and behavior.

Abstract: Objectives. Newspapers play a key role in disseminating information and shaping perceptions about health, research, and policies. Inadequate or misleading reporting constitutes a public health threat that can jeopardize individual health and lead to harmful health policies. Methods. Surveys were mailed to 165 reporters at 122 newspapers in 5 Midwest states. The association of training, newspaper size, and experience with reporter's self-perceived reporting ability was assessed. Results. The response rate was 69.6% (115/165). Between 66% and 85% of the reporters assessed 4 tasks vital to sound health reporting as "sometimes difficult" to "nearly always difficult." No significant differences in perceived ability were found by training or newspaper size. Respondents with less experience reported higher perceived ability. Conclusions. These findings show that reporters may have difficulty understanding complex health issues and interpreting statistics because they are inadequately trained.

Abstract: Objectives. This study assessed factors related to chlamydial infection among young men in the United States. Methods. Data were from interviews of nationally representative samples of 470 men aged 18 to 19 years (teenagers) and 995 men aged 22 to 26 years (young adults) and from urine specimens tested by means of polymerase chain reaction. Results. Although a majority of the men reported occasional unprotected intercourse, only a minority perceived themselves to be at risk for contracting a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Chlamydial infection was detected in 3.1% of the teenagers and 4.5% of the young adults. A minority of those infected had symptoms or had been tested for STDs; very few had been diagnosed with STDs. Conclusions. Chlamydial infection is common but usually asymptomatic and undiagnosed. Primary and secondary prevention efforts should be increased, particularly among young adult men.

Abstract: Objectives. This study determined the effects of nurse staffing and nursing organization on the likelihood of needlestick injuries in hospital nurses, Methods. We analyzed retrospective data from 732 and prospective data from 960 nurses on needlestick exposures and near misses over different 1-month periods in 1990 and 1991. Staffing levels and survey data about working climate and risk factors for needlestick injuries were collected on 40 units in 20 hospitals. Results. Nurses from units with low staffing and poor organizational climates were generally twice as likely as nurses on well-staffed and better-organized units to report risk factors, needlestick injuries, and near misses. Conclusions. Staffing and organizational climate influence hospital nurses' likelihood of sustaining needlestick injuries. Remedying problems with understaffing, inadequate administrative support, and poor morale could reduce needlestick injuries.

Issue: 7
Pages: 1125-1130
Abstract: Objectives. This study determined to what extent lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) populations have been studied over the past 20 years of public health research. Methods. From MEDLINE English-language articles on human subjects published between 1980 and 1999, I identified articles that included LGBT individuals. The abstracts were analyzed with a coding procedure that categorized the content by topic, sexual orientation, and race/ethnicity. Results. LGBT issues were addressed by 3777 articles, or 0.1% of all Medline articles; 61% of the articles were disease-specific, and 85% omitted reference to race/ethnicity. Research unrelated to sexually transmitted diseases addressed lesbians and gay men with similar frequency, whereas bisexual persons were less frequently considered, and the least amount of research focused on transgender individuals. Conclusions. Findings supported that LGBT issues have been neglected by public health research and that research unrelated to sexually transmitted diseases is lacking.

Abstract: Objectives. This study estimated national prevalence rates of medication noncompliance due to cost and resulting health problems among adults with disabilities. Methods. Analyses involved 25805 respondents to the Disability Follow-Back Survey, a supplement to the 1994 and 1995 National Health Interview Surveys. Results. Findings showed that about 1.3 million adults with disabilities did not take their medications as prescribed because of cost, and more than half reported health problems as a result. Severe disability, poor health, low income, lack of insurance, and a high number of prescriptions increased the odds of being noncompliant as a result of cost. Conclusions. Prescription noncompliance due to cost is a serious problem for many adults with chronic disease or disability. Most would not be helped by any of the current proposals to expand Medicare drug coverage.

Abstract: Objectives. We examined the effect of routine screening on breast cancer staging by race/ethnicity. Methods. We used a 1990 to 1998 mammography database (N = 5182) of metropolitan Denver, Colo, women to examine each racial/ethnic cohort's incident cancer cases (n = 1902) and tumor stage distribution given similar patterns of routine screening use. Results. Regardless of race/ethnicity, women participating in routine screenings had earlier-stage disease by 5 to 13 percentage points. After control for possible confounding factors, White women were more likely to have early-stage disease compared with Black and Hispanic women. Conclusions. Lack of screening coverage in certain racial/ethnic populations has often been cited as a reason for tumor stage differences at detection. In this study, correcting for screening did not completely reduce stage differentials among Black and Hispanic women.

Abstract: Numerous policy challenges continue to face the United States in the third decade of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, in both the health and foreign policy arenas. They include longstanding questions about care, treatment, prevention, and research, as well as new ones introduced by the changing nature of the epidemic itself and the need to balance demands for limited resources. These challenges concern the United States not only in its role as a world leader in combating a global epidemic but in its decisions and focus at home, where the epidemic continues to take a toll.

Abstract: To support cancer control efforts, the National Program of Cancer Registries was established to enhance or develop cancer registries in every state. But there is an alternative. State cancer control programs could be adequately planned and evaluated without a cancer registry, and federal support of cancer registration could be selectively provided to registries that provide data needed to monitor cancer incidence and survival for the nation or that serve as a resource for population-based etiologic and cancer control research. The funds saved could be redirected to support the continued collection of high-quality cancer incidence and survival data for the nation as such efforts become more costly and complex in the future, and to expand support of population-based cancer research efforts.

Abstract: Controversies in the conduct of international research continue to pose challenges for the system of ethical review, particularly for developing countries. Although the concept of vulnerability is key to addressing these challenges, ethical review has typically ignored the agency of vulnerable participants and groups in determining what kind of review process is needed. Concurrent with developments shaping the new public health that seek to operationalize empowerment of communities by placing them as initiators and organizers of their own health, ethical review of public health research must find ways to recognize the agency of vulnerable individuals, groups, and communities in the review process if it is to address effectively the ethical dilemmas currently evident in collaborative international research.

Abstract: Ensuring that advances in genomics are applied to the health improvement of people living in developing countries is an important contemporary challenge. In the near term, such advances are likely to alleviate infectious diseases, with longer-term benefits envisaged for chronic disorders. To ensure that benefits are shared by developing countries, attention must be paid to complex ethical, legal, social, and economic issues, as well as to public education and engagement. Creative and equitable international mechanisms and goodwill are needed to turn high hopes into reality and allow the use of genomics to reduce health inequities between rich and poor nations.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined rural-urban gradients in US suicide mortality and the extent to which such gradients varied across time, sex, and age. Methods. Using a 10-category rural-urban continuum measure and 1970-1997 county mortality data, we estimated rural-urban differentials in suicide mortality over time by multiple regression and Poisson regression models. Results. Significant rural-urban gradients in age-adjusted male suicide mortality were found in each time period, indicating rising suicide rates with increasing levels of rurality. The gradient increased consistently, suggesting widening rural-urban differentials in male suicides over time. When controlled for geographic variation in divorce rate and ethnic composition, rural men, in each age cohort, had about twice the suicide rate of their most urban counterparts. Observed rural-urban differentials for women diminished overtime. In 1995 to 1997, the adjusted suicide rates for young and working-age women were 85% and 22% higher, respectively, in rural than in the most urban areas. Conclusions. The slope of the relationship between rural-urban continuum and suicide mortality varied substantially by time, sex, and age. Widening rural-urban disparities in suicide may reflect differential changes over time in key social integration indicators.

Abstract: Objectives. This article presents nationally representative data on the effects of privatization on local health departments (LHDs). Methods. A stratified representative national sample of 380 LHDs was drawn from a national list of 2488 departments, Telephone interviews were conducted with 347 LHD directors. Results. One half of the directors of LHDs with privatized services reported that privatization helped the performance of core functions. Privatization often resulted in increased time needed for management and administration. More than a third of LHD directors reported concern about loss of control over the performance of privatized functions and services. Conclusions. Privatization is part of a broader shift toward "managing" rather than directly providing public health services, yet privatization often reduces LHDs' control over the performance of services.

Abstract: In the past few years, US federal agencies governing research with human subjects and institutional review boards have taken a higher-profile path than ever before, both at home and internationally. This trend carries profound significance for US-based institutions and has implications also for the rest of the world. What does this critical moment of heightened federal scrutiny mean for the workings of US institutional review boards? We examined board activity across 3 dimensions: time, place, and consciousness. We conclude that although institutions in all areas of biomedical and social science research are adapting their practices, the field of public health is especially well positioned to adapt to, and succeed in, new efforts to ensure protection of human research subjects.

Abstract: Objectives. In 1993, the government of Pakistan started a new approach to the delivery of contraceptive services by training literate married women to provide doorstep advice and supplies in their own and neighboring communities. This report assesses whether this community-based approach is starting to have an impact on contraceptive use in rural areas. Methods. A clustered nationally representative survey was used to collect data on contraceptive use and access to services in each cluster. Two-level logistic regression was applied to assess the effects of service access, after potential confounders were taken into account. Results. Married women living within 5 km of 2 community-based workers were significantly more likely to be using a modern, reversible method of contraception than those with no access (odds ratio = 1.74; 95% confidence interval = 1.11, 2.71). Conclusions. After decades of failure, the managers of the family planning program have designed a way of presenting modern contraceptives that is appropriate to the conditions of rural Pakistan. The new community-based approach should be steadily expanded.

Abstract: Objectives. In this study we examined the relationship between indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) and mortality for a representative sample of individuals. Methods. The sample included 3734 individuals aged 45 and older interviewed in 1984 in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. In the current study, mortality was tracked between 1984 and 1994 and is related to SES indicators of education, occupation, income, and wealth. Results. Wealth and recent family income were the indicators that were most strongly associated with subsequent mortality. These associations persisted after we controlled for the other SES indicators and were stronger for women than for men and for nonelderly than for elderly individuals. Conclusions. We found that the economic indicators of SES were usually as strongly associated with mortality as, if not more strongly associated with mortality than, the more conventional indicators of completed schooling and occupation.

Abstract: Objectives. This report describes the history, true goals, and effects of tobacco industry-sponsored youth smoking prevention programs. Methods. We analyzed previously-secret tobacco industry documents. Results. The industry started these programs in the 1980s to forestall legislation that would restrict industry activities. Industry programs portray smoking as an adult choice and fail to discuss how tobacco advertising promotes smoking or the health dangers of smoking. The industry has used these programs to fight taxes, clean-indoor-air laws, and marketing restrictions worldwide. There is no evidence that these programs decrease smoking among youths. Conclusions. Tobacco industry youth programs do more harm than good for tobacco control. The tobacco industry should not be allowed to run or directly fund youth smoking prevention programs.

Abstract: Objectives. Recent research suggests that in utero exposure to maternal smoking is a risk factor for conduct disorder and delinquency. We review evidence of causality, a controversial but important public health question. Methods. We analyzed studies of maternal prenatal smoking and offspring antisocial behavior within a causal framework. Results. The association is (1) independent of confounders, (2) present across diverse contexts, and (3) consistent with basic science. Methodological limitations of existing studies preclude causal conclusions. Conclusions. Existing evidence provides consistent support for, but not proof of, an etiologic role for prenatal smoking in the onset of antisocial behavior. The possibility of identifying a preventable prenatal risk factor for a serious mental disorder makes further research on this topic important for public health.

Abstract: Objectives. This study compared success in smoking cessation by sex, ethnic status, and birth cohort. Methods. African and European American respondents to the 1996 Current Population Survey (tobacco supplement) and the 1987 National Health Interview Survey (cancer control and cancer epidemiology supplements) constituted the study population. Elapsed time from smoking initiation to cessation was compared via nonparametric tests and survival analysis techniques. Results. Findings showed that success in quitting was independent of ethnic status and sex and that population differences in smoking initiation age (assuming no differences in quitting behavior) could produce statistical associations between sex/ethnicity and smoking cessation. Conclusions. Population differences in smoking initiation patterns can mask similarities in cessation rates.

Abstract: Objectives. We calculated regional and sex- and age-specific smoking prevalence estimates worldwide in 1995. Methods. Sex-specific smoking prevalence data from studies in 139 countries and age distribution data from 7 studies were analyzed. Results. Globally, 29% of persons aged 15 years or older were regular smokers in 1995. Four fifths of the world's 1.1 billion smokers lived in low- or middle-income countries. East Asian countries accounted for a disproportionately high percentage (38%) of the world's smokers. Males accounted for four fifths of all smokers, and prevalence among males and females was highest among those aged 30 to 49 years (34%). Conclusions. Future decades will see dramatic increases in tobacco-attributable deaths in low- and middle-income regions. Although much of this excess mortality can be prevented if smokers stop smoking, quitting remains rare in low- and middle-income countries.

Abstract: Objectives. This study assessed the tobacco cessation knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of dentists participating in a large managed care dental plan. Methods. Participating dentists in 4 states were surveyed via mail. Results. Dentists' perceived success in helping patients quit using tobacco was highly correlated with discussion of specific strategies for quitting, advice about the use of nicotine gum, and time spent counseling patients. Dentists who were confident about their smoking cessation knowledge frequently advised patients to quit and spent more time counseling patients about tobacco cessation. Conclusions. Tobacco cessation is not a routine part of dental practice. Knowledge, time spent counseling patients, and specific strategies for quitting were associated with dentists' perceptions of success.

Abstract: Objectives. This report describes and examines factors significantly associated with smoking among Chinese Americans, using multiple logistic regression methods. Methods. We conducted a population-based survey (n=644, age=40-69 years) in Chicago's Chinatown using a Chinese questionnaire based on the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). Results. Smoking prevalence was 34% for males and 2% for females. Some 93% of current smokers had smoked regularly for 10 or more years. Low education (odds ratio [OR]=2.41; 95% confidence interval [Cl]=1.31, 4.46), use of a non-Western physician or clinic for health care (OR = 2.64; 95% Cl = 1.46, 4.80), and no knowledge of early cancer warning signs and symptoms (OR = 2.52; 95% Cl = 1.35, 4.70) were significantly associated with smoking among men. Conclusions. The male prevalence of smoking is higher than those reported in California, the NHIS, and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS); exceeds the rate for African Americans aged 18 years and older; is comparable with the rate for African American males aged 45 to 64 years; and is far above the Healthy People 2010 target goal of less than 12%. Multisite surveys and smoking cessation campaigns in Chinese are needed.

Pages: 955-960
Abstract: Objectives. The goal of this study was to describe how the tobacco industry collects information about public health groups. Methods. Publicly available internal tobacco industry documents were reviewed and analyzed using a chronological case study approach. Results. The industry engaged in aggressive intelligence gathering, used intermediaries to obtain materials under false pretenses, sent public relations spies to the organizations' meetings, and covertly taped strategy sessions. Other industry strategies included publicly minimizing the effects of boycotts, painting health advocates as "extreme," identifying and exploiting disagreements, and planning to "redirect the funding" of tobacco control organizations to other purposes. Conclusions. Public health advocates often make light of tobacco industry observers, but industry surveillance may be real, intense, and covert and may obstruct public health initiatives.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined tobacco use rates and potential predictors of use among Asian Americans residing in the Delaware Valley region. Methods. A cross-sectional survey design was used. The sample consisted of 1174 Chinese, Koreans, Vietnamese, and Cambodians. Results. Findings indicated that the mean age at initiation of tobacco use was 18.3 years. Among the respondents, 40.2% had a history of tobacco use, and 29.6% were current users. Men were more likely than women to smoke. There were significant differences between never smokers, current smokers, and ex-smokers in sex, ethnicity, educational attainment, and marital and employment status. Conclusions. The findings suggest that tobacco use is still a serious public health problem among Asian Americans, especially men.

Volume: 92

Abstract: The issue of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and the harms it causes to non-smoking bystanders has occupied a central place in the rhetoric and strategy of anti-smoking forces in the United States over the past 3 decades. Beginning in the 1970s, anti-tobacco activists drew on suggestive and incomplete evidence to push for far-reaching prohibitions on smoking in a variety of public settings. Public health professionals and other antismoking activists, although concerned about the potential illness and death that ETS might cause in nonsmokers, also used restrictions on public smoking as a way to erode the social acceptability of cigarettes and thereby reduce smoking prevalence. This strategy was necessitated by the context of American political culture, especially the hostility toward public health interventions that are overtly paternalistic.

Abstract: Objectives. To improve tobacco control campaigns, we analyzed tobacco industry strategies that encourage young adults (aged 18 to 24) to smoke. Methods. Initial searches of tobacco industry documents with keywords (e.g., "young adult.") were extended by using names, locations, and dates. Results. Approximately 200 relevant documents were found. Transitions from experimentation to addiction, with adult levels of cigarette consumption, may take years. Tobacco marketing solidifies addiction among young adults. Cigarette advertisements encourage regular smoking and increased consumption by integrating smoking into activities and places where young adults' lives change (e.g., leaving home, college, jobs, the military, bars). Conclusions. Tobacco control efforts should include both adults and youths. Life changes are also opportunities to stop occasional smokers' progress to addiction. Clean air policies in workplaces, the military, bars, colleges, and homes can combat tobacco marketing.

Abstract: Objectives. This study compared the present economic value of the 1998 tobacco settlement with the present economic value of the damages attributable to tobacco. Methods. The 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey was used to estimate the smoking attributable fraction (SAF) of medical expenditures. SAFs were then applied to Medicaid and other expenditures. Results. Settlement payments covered only 40% of Medicaid treatment costs already incurred and only 30% of past and projected future Medicaid costs. Excess medical expenditures for all other payment sources were roughly comparable to those incurred by Medicaid. Conclusions. Although the settlement may reduce future smoking prevalence rates by limiting the ability of tobacco companies to promote smoking and by raising cigarette prices, euphoria over the huge settlement funds should be balanced by a sober comparison with the even larger damage amounts.

Abstract: Objectives. This study sought to determine the effects of the California Tobacco Control Program on tobacco-related attitudes and behaviors. Methods. In 1996 and 1998, a telephone survey was conducted among adults in randomly selected households in 18 California counties. Tenth-grade youths in 84 randomly selected high schools completed a written survey. In analyses conducted at the county level, differences in outcomes were regressed on an index of program exposure. Results. Among adults, program exposure was associated with decreased smoking prevalence rates, increased no-smoking policies in homes, and decreased violations of workplace no-smoking policies. Among youths, there was no effect of program exposure on outcomes. Conclusions. These results suggest that the California Tobacco Control Program may have reduced adult smoking prevalence rates and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examines how the American Legacy Foundation's "truth" campaign and Philip Morris's "Think. Don't Smoke" campaign have influenced youths' attitudes, beliefs, and intentions toward tobacco. Methods. We analyzed 2 telephone surveys of 12- to 17-year-olds with multivariate logistic regressions: a baseline survey conducted before the launch of "truth" and a second survey 10 months into the "truth" campaign. Results. Exposure to "truth" countermarketing advertisements was consistently associated with an increase in anti-tobacco attitudes and beliefs, whereas exposure to Philip Morris advertisements generally was not. In addition, those exposed to Philip Morris advertisements were more likely to be open to the idea of smoking. Conclusions. Whereas exposure to the "truth" campaign positively changed youths' attitudes toward tobacco, the Philip Morris campaign had a counterproductive influence.

Abstract: Objectives. This study determined the life extension obtained from stopping smoking at various ages. Methods. We estimated the relation between smoking and mortality among 877 243 respondents to the Cancer Prevention Study II. These estimates were applied to the 1990 US census population to examine the longevity benefits of smoking cessation. Results. Life expectancy among smokers who quit at age 35 exceeded that of continuing smokers by 6.9 to 8.5 years for men and 6.1 to 7.7 years for women. Smokers who quit at younger ages realized greater life extensions. However, even those who quit much later in life gained some benefits: among smokers who quit at age 65 years, men gained 1.4 to 2.0 years of life, and women gained 2.7 to 3.7 years. Conclusions. Stopping smoking as early as possible is important, but cessation at any age provides meaningful life extensions.

Abstract: Objectives. This study determined the prevalence of Minnesota urban youths reaching the Healthy People 2010 objectives for obesity and intake of fat, calcium, fruits, vegetables, and grains and compared prevalence rates across sociodemographic characteristics. Methods. The study sample included 4746 adolescents (aged 11-18 years) from the Minneapolis/St. Paul area who completed dietary surveys and participated in anthropometric measurements as part of a school-based population study. Results. Considerable gaps were seen between the existing prevalence rates for obesity and nutrient and food patterns and the targeted Healthy People 2010 prevalence rates. For example, 12.5% of the girls and 16.6% of the boys had body mass index values at or greater than the 95th percentile (target= 5%). Only 29.5% of the girls and 42.5% of the boys were meeting the daily recommended intakes for calcium (target = 75%). Similarly, percentages of youths consuming the recommended amounts of fat, fruits, vegetables, and grains were lower than the targeted percentages. There were large sociodemographic disparities in obesity and eating patterns, particularly across race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Conclusions. Concerted public health efforts are needed to achieve the Healthy People 2010 objectives for obesity and nutrition and to reduce racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities.

Abstract: Objectives. This article assesses pastor-level factors that affect the successful recruitment and implementation of community-based health promotion programs in Black churches. Methods. Semistructured interviews with 16 pastors of Black churches were analyzed for content. Results. We found that although the involvement of Black pastors in an array of secular activities makes them open to participate in health programs, their overcommitment to other issues can negatively influence their ability to participate. Second, although Black pastors appreciate being included in and benefiting from health research, minorities' history of being underserved and exploited can lead to suspiciousness and reluctance to participate. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that those interested in developing church-based health programs in the Black community must be attuned to how the same factors can both facilitate and hinder a program's development.

Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Colgrove, J.

Issue: 5
Pages: 725-729
Abstract: The historical analyses of Thomas McKeown attributed the modern rise in the world population from the 1700s to the present to broad economic and social changes rather than to targeted public health or medical interventions. His work generated considerable controversy in the 1970s and 1980s, and it continues to stimulate support, criticism, and commentary to the present day, in spite of his conclusions' having been largely discredited by subsequent research. The ongoing resonance of his work is due primarily to the importance of the question that underlay it: Are public health ends better served by targeted interventions or by broad-based efforts to redistribute the social, political, and economic resources that determine the health of populations?

Abstract: The human right to adequate housing is enshrined in international law. The right to adequate housing can be traced to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was unanimously adopted by the world community in 1948. Since that time, the right to adequate housing has been reaffirmed on numerous occasions and further defined and elaborated. A key component of this right is habitability of housing, which should comply with health and safety standards. Therefore, the right to adequate housing provides an additional tool for advocates and others interested in promoting healthful housing and living conditions and thereby protecting individual and community health.

Abstract: Objectives, This study was designed to assess sociodemographic and medical insurer factors associated with receipt of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Methods, Patients included (n=959) were enrolled in the Johns Hopkins HIV Clinic after April 1, 1996, received ≥90 days of care, and had a CD4 count ≥500 cells/mm3 or HIV-1 RNA &gt; 20 000 copies/mL. We assessed the associations of sociodemographic factors and medical insurance with receipt of HAART, stratified by 2 time periods (April 1996 through March 1997 versus April 1997 through March 1999). Results. HAART was more likely to be used in patients who were &gt;39 years, White, had CD4 counts &lt;350 cells/mm3, had fewer missed clinic visits, and did not have intravenous drug use as their risk factor for HIV transmission. In period 1 (April 1996 through March 1997), HAART was more likely to be used in patients who were commercially insured than in other payer groups; differences between payers narrowed in period 2 (April 1997 through March 1999), however, as did differences by race. Conclusions. Differences in use of HAART on the basis of payer have narrowed since 1996. This encouraging finding may demonstrate the importance of programs that lower economic barriers to medical care.

Abstract: Objectives. This study explored wait-listing decisions among African American and White men and women eligible for kidney transplants, focusing on lifetime experiences of race and sex discrimination as a possible influence. Methods. Patient records from 3 Baltimore-area hemodialysis units were reviewed, and semistructured face-to-face interviews were conducted with transplant-eligible patients and with unit staff members. Results. African American patients reported more racial discrimination, and women reported more sex discrimination. Women and older patients were less likely to be placed on the waiting list, as were patients with previous experiences of racial discrimination. Discrimination measures predicted list access more strongly than patient race. Conclusions. Lifetime experience of and response to discrimination may contribute to race and sex differences in access to care and should be included in research on health care disparities.

Title: The anthrax vaccine program: An analysis of the CDC's recommendations for vaccine use
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Nass, M.

Volume: 92
Issue: 5
Pages: 715-721
Abstract: The anthrax vaccine was never proved to be safe and effective. It is one cause of Gulf War illnesses, and recent vaccinees report symptoms resembling Gulf War illnesses. The vaccine's production has been substandard. Without adequate evaluation, the Food and Drug Administration recently approved (retrospectively) significant changes made to the vaccine's composition since 1990. The vaccine's mandatory use for inhalation anthrax is "off-label." A skewed review of the vaccine literature by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) led to remunerative collaborative research with the army, involving civilian volunteers. Despite acknowledging possible fetal harm, the CDC offered the vaccine to children and pregnant women. New trends could weaken prelicensure efficacy and safety review of medical products intended for biodefense and avoid manufacturer liability for their use.

Abstract: For many poor Americans, having a decent home and suitable living environment remains a dream. This lack of adequate housing is not only a burden for many of the poor, but it is harmful to the larger society as well, because of the adverse effects of inadequate housing on public health. Not only is the failure to provide adequate housing short-sighted from a policy perspective, but it is also a failure to live up to societal obligations. There is a societal obligation to meet the housing needs of everyone, including the most disadvantaged. Housing assistance must become a federally-funded entitlement.

Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Szreter, S.

Volume: 92
Issue: 5
Pages: 722-725
Abstract: Thomas McKeown was a rhetorically powerful critic, from the inside, of the medical profession's mid-20th-century love affair with curative and scientific medicine. He emphasized instead the importance of economic growth, rising living standards, and improved nutrition as the primary sources of most historical improvements in the health of developed nations. This interpretation failed to emphasize the simultaneous historical importance of an accompanying redistributive social philosophy and practical politics, which has characterized the public health movement from its 19th-century origins. Consequently, the current generation of public health practitioners are having to reconstruct such a politics and practice following its virtual dismantlement during the last 2 decades of the 20th century.

Abstract: Objectives. The goal of this study was to identify differences between gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (GLBT) homeless youths and their heterosexual counterparts in terms of physical and mental health difficulties. Methods. A sample of 84 GLBT adolescents was matched in regard to age and self-reported gender with 84 heterosexual adolescents. The 2 samples were compared on a variety of psychosocial variables. Results. GLBT adolescents left home more frequently, were victimized more often, used highly addictive substances more frequently, had higher rates of psychopathology, and had more sexual partners than heterosexual adolescents. Conclusions. Homeless youths who identify themselves as members of sexual minority groups are at increased risk for negative outcomes. Recommendations for treatment programs and implications for public health are discussed.

Abstract: Objectives. This study sought to estimate the impact on birthweight of maternal participation in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, infants, and Children (WIC). Methods. WIC estimates were based on sibling models incorporating data on children born between 1990 and 1996 to women taking part in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Results. Fixed-effects estimates indicated that prenatal WIC participation was associated with a 0.075 unit difference (95% confidence interval [CI]= 0.007, 0.157) in siblings' logged birthweight. At the 88-oz (2464-g) low-birthweight cutoff, this difference translated into an estimated impact of 6.6 oz (184.8 g). Conclusion. Earlier WIC impact estimates may have been biased by unmeasured characteristics affecting both program participation and birth outcomes. Our approach controlled for such biases and revealed a significant positive association between WIC participation and birthweight.

This study sought to determine adherence of physicians to tuberculosis (TB) screening guidelines among foreign-born persons living in the United States who were applying for permanent residency. Methods. Medical forms of applicants from 5 geographic areas were reviewed, along with information from a national physician database on attending physicians. Applicant and corresponding physician characteristics were compared among those who were and were not correctly screened. Results. Of 5739 applicants eligible for screening via tuberculin skin test, 75% were appropriately screened. Except in San Diego, where 11% of the applicants received no screening, most of the inappropriate screening resulted from the use of chest x-rays as the initial. screening tool. Conclusions. Focused physician education and periodic monitoring of adherence to screening guidelines are warranted.

Abstract: Objectives. This study assessed progress in achieving clean indoor air in California. Methods. Data were from large, cross-sectional population-based surveys (1990-1999). Results. Indoor workers reporting smoke-free workplaces increased from 35.0% (95% confidence interval [Cl]=33.7, 36.3) in 1990 to 93.4% (95% Cl=92.6, 94.2) in 1999. Exposure of nonsmoking indoor workers to secondhand tobacco smoke decreased from 29.0% (95% Cl=27.2, 30.8) to 15.6% (95% CI=14.1, 17.1). Adults with smoke-free homes increased from 37.6% (95% Cl=35.1, 40.1) in 1992 to 73.7% (95% Cl=73.2, 74.2) in 1999; nearly half of smokers in 1999 had smoke-free homes. In 1999, 82.2% (95% Cl=81.5, 82.9) of children and adolescents (0-17 years) had smoke-free homes, up from 38.0% (95% Cl=35.1, 40.9) in 1992. Conclusions. California's advances highlight an important opportunity for tobacco control.

Abstract: Objectives. This report identifies trends in the number and rate of deaths due to law enforcement actions (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, category "legal intervention") in the United States. Methods. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Compressed Mortality File was used to determine age-, race-, and sex-specific death rates due to legal intervention for the years 1979 through 1997. Results. Males account for nearly all deaths, with the death rate for Black males several times that of White males. For both Whites and Blacks, the highest rates of death were observed for ages 20 to 34. Death rates declined significantly from 1979 to 1988 and remained stable thereafter. Conclusions. While legal intervention is an uncommon cause of death, some sub-populations experience rates of death many times that of the US population as a whole.

Abstract: In 1920, Indiana's Division of Infant and Child Hygiene inaugurated its first Better Babies Contest at the state fair. For the next 12 years, these contests were the centerpiece of a dynamic infant and maternal welfare program that took shape in Indiana during the decade of the federal Sheppard-Towner act. More than just a lively spectacle for fairgoers, these contests brought public health, "race betterment," and animal breeding together in a unique manner. This article describes one of the most popular expressions of public health and race betterment in rural America. It also raises questions about the intersections between hereditarian and medical conceptions of human improvement during the early 20th century, especially with respect to child breeding and rearing.

The sample (n = 948) was stratified by charge type (felony vs misdemeanor) and race/ethnicity (African American, non-Hispanic White, Hispanic, other). Results. Non-Hispanic White women, women arrested for less serious charges, women who had prior arrests, women arrested on drug charges, and women with severe mental disorders were at especially high risk for sexual and injection drug transmission of HIV and AIDS. Conclusions. Many women at risk for HIV and AIDS - women who use drugs, women who trade sex for money or drugs, homeless women, and women with mental disorders - eventually will cycle through jail. Because most jail detainees return to their communities within days, providing HIV and AIDS education in jail must become a public health priority.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined factors associated with emergency department use among homeless and marginally housed persons. Methods. Interviews were conducted with 2578 homeless and marginally housed persons, and factors associated with different patterns of emergency department use were assessed in multivariate models. Results. Findings showed that 40.4% of respondents had 1 or more emergency department encounters in the previous year; 7.9% exhibited high rates of use (more than 3 visits) and accounted for 54.5% of all visits. Factors associated with high use rates included less stable housing, victimization, arrests, physical and mental illness, and substance abuse. Predisposing and need factors appeared to drive emergency department use. Conclusions. Efforts to reduce emergency department use among the homeless should be targeted toward addressing underlying risk factors among those exhibiting high rates of use.

Abstract: Objectives. We describe the prevalence of asthma risk factors within racial/ethnic and language groups of infants participating in an intervention study for reducing chronic asthma. Methods. Low-income children aged 9 to 24 months with 3 or more episodes of wheezing illness were enrolled. Baseline information included family and medical histories, allergic status, environmental exposures, emotional environment, and caregiver psychosocial resources. Results. Racial/ethnic and language groups - European Americans, African Americans, high-acculturated Hispanics, and low-acculturated Hispanics - Showed different patterns of risk factors for childhood asthma, with low-acculturated Hispanics showing the most distinctive pattern. Conclusions. Patterns of covariation of biological and psychosocial risk factors for childhood asthma were associated with racial/ethnic and language status among urban, low-income children.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined whether body mass index (BMI) or change in BMI raises the risk of disability in adulthood. Methods. The relation between BMI and upper- and lower-body disability was examined among adult subjects from a national longitudinal survey (n = 6833). Tobit regression models were used to examine the effect of BMI on disability 10 and 20 years later. Results. Obesity (BMI≥30) at baseline or becoming obese during the study was associated with higher levels of upper- and, especially, lower-body disability. In persons who began the study with a BMI of 30 or more and became normal weight, disability was not reduced. Underweight persons (BMI < 18.5) also manifested higher disability in most instances. Conclusions. Disability risk was higher for obese persons, but overweight was not consistently associated with higher disability.

Abstract: In an accompanying commentary, Colgrove indicates that McKeown's thesis - that dramatic reductions in mortality over the past 2 centuries were due to improved socioeconomic conditions rather than to medical or public health interventions - has been "overturned" and his theory "discredited." McKeown sought to explain a very prominent trend in population health and did so with a strong emphasis on the importance of basic social and economic conditions. If Colgrove is right about the McKeown thesis, social epidemiology is left with a gaping hole in its explanatory repertoire and a challenge to a cherished principle about the importance of social factors in health. We return to the trend McKeown focused upon - post-McKeown and post-Colgrove - to indicate how and why social conditions must continue to be seen as fundamental causes of disease.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the effect of birth cohort on incidence rates of hip fracture among women and men in the Framingham Study. Methods. Age-specific incidence rates of first hip fracture were presented according to tertile of year of birth for 5209 participants of the Framingham Study, a population-based cohort followed since 1948. Sex-specific incidence rate ratios were calculated by Cox regression to assess the relation between birth cohort and hip fracture incidence. Results. An increasing trend in hip fracture incidence rates was observed with year of birth for women (trend, P=.05) and men (trend, P=.03). Relative to those born from 1887 to 1900 (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.0), age-specific incidence rates were greatest in the most recent birth cohort, born from 1911 to 1921 (IRR=1.4 for women, IRR=2,0 for men), and intermediate in those born from 1901 to 1910 (IRR=1.2 for women, IRR=1.5 for men). Conclusions. Results suggest risk of hip fracture is increasing for successive birth cohorts. Projections that fail to account for the increase in rates associated with birth cohort underestimate the future public health impact of hip fracture in the United States.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined whether differences in heat alone, as opposed to public health interventions or other factors, accounted for the reduction in heat-related deaths and paramedic emergency medical service (EMS) runs between 1995 and 1999 during 2 heat waves occurring in Milwaukee, Wis. Methods. Two previously described prediction models were adapted to compare expected and observed heat-related morbidity and mortality in 1999 based on the city's 1995 experience. Results. Both models showed that heat-related deaths and EMS runs in 1999 were at least 49% lower than levels predicted by the 1995 relation between heat and heat-related deaths or EMS runs. Conclusions. Reductions in heat-related morbidity and mortality in 1999 were not attributable to differences in heat levels alone. Changes in public health preparedness and response may also have contributed to these reductions.

Abstract: Poor housing conditions are associated with a wide range of health conditions, including respiratory infections, asthma, lead poisoning, injuries, and mental health. Addressing housing issues offers public health practitioners an opportunity to address an important social determinant of health. Public health has long been involved in housing issues. In the 19th century, health officials targeted poor sanitation, crowding, and inadequate ventilation to reduce infectious diseases as well as fire hazards to decrease injuries. Today, public health departments can employ multiple strategies to improve housing, such as developing and enforcing housing guidelines and codes, implementing "Healthy Homes" programs to improve indoor environmental quality, assessing housing conditions, and advocating for healthy, affordable housing. Now is the time for public health to create healthier homes by confronting substandard housing.

Pages: 552-556
Abstract: The United States' international ranking for infant mortality slipped from 19th in the 1980s to 27th in 1997. This slippage may be related to the segregation of priorities that occurred early in the 1990s, when national concern was diverted from infant mortality to minority health. To rekindle concern about infant mortality to the level of effective action, public health professionals must refocus the public's attention on assuring that all women are provided adequate education and services to help them avoid unintended pregnancies, that all pregnant women receive services in appropriate facilities, and that the causes of preterm deliveries are discovered. Effective action in these areas would not only improve infant mortality overall; it would also reduce racial and ethnic disparities in infant health.

Abstract: A national conference convened in May 2001 explored health disparities among minority women. It included 5 one-hour workshops that randomly assigned each participant to 1 of 4 groups. Groups generated recommendations on conference topics and from these identified priority recommendations. Trained facilitators guided groups through brainstorming and weighted voting processes; individual recommendations were submitted in writing. Participants generated 598 recommendations, 71 of them voted as priorities; these were analyzed to capture participants' "messages." Central themes focused on access issues and cultural incompetence as deterrents to the elimination of health disparities and on education, funding, and community-based, community-driven research as mechanisms for change. Strategies for change included reinventing or expanding the role of minority communities and changing health care itself and "how" it does its work. The essential element in all recommendations was community leadership and control.

Abstract: Objectives: This study compared health indicators among self-identified lesbians/bisexual women and heterosexual women residing in Los Angeles County. Methods. Respondents were English-speaking Hispanic, African American, and Asian American women. Health status, behavioral risks, access barriers, and indicators of health care were assessed. Results. Prevalence rates of chronic health conditions were similar among women in the 3 racial/ethnic groups. However, lesbians and bisexual women evidenced higher behavioral risks and lower rates of preventive care than heterosexual women. Conclusions. Among racial/ethnic minority women, minority sexual orientation is associated with increased health risks. The effects of sexual minority status need to be considered in addressing health disparities affecting this population.

Abstract: Little is known about the health of Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) women, a rapidly growing population marked by diverse sociodemographic characteristics, health needs, and access to and use of health services. This commentary provides broad recommendations for research, program development, and policy development based on the first-ever White House Initiative report on AAPIs. These recommendations address the issues of data, access, civil rights, community capacity, and the need to recognize ethnic subgroups among the AAPI population. Reflecting on the events of the past year, the recommendations provide direction for public health to address the health and well-being of AAPI women.

Abstract: This commentary examines how women of color fare on the use of preventive care. Logistic regression models of women's use of preventive care were computed with data from the 1994 Commonwealth Fund Minority Health Survey. It was found that having a regular doctor was the most consistent predictor of the use of preventive care, irrespective of the women's racial/ethnic background, socioeconomic circumstances, or place of residence. These findings reinforce the importance of physicians in the delivery of preventive care. Suggestions for improving the use of preventive services by women of color are provided.

Abstract: Objectives. This study explored associations between racism, social class, and health among ethnic minority people in England and Wales. Methods. We conducted a series of regression analyses on cross-sectional data from the Fourth National Survey of Ethnic Minorities to explore the relation between different indicators of racism and health and household occupational class. Results. Marked independent associations existed between reported experience of racism and perceptions of Britain as a "racist society," household social class, age, sex, and various mental and physical health indicators. These associations showed reasonable consistency across the different ethnic groups. Conclusions. The different ways in which racism may manifest itself (as interpersonal violence, institutional discrimination, or socioeconomic disadvantage) all have independent detrimental effects on health, regardless of the health indicator used.

Abstract: Objectives. This study assessed the relationship between risk factors for cervical cancer and Papanicolaou (Pap) test use within the past year among reproductive-age women. Methods. The 1995 National Survey of Family Growth, a demographic and reproductive health survey of 10 847 women aged 15 to 44, was analyzed with multiple logistic regression. Results. Of the women, 62% reported having had a Pap test within the past year. Use was significantly higher among women with risk factors and among African American women. Use was significantly lower among uninsured, poor, and foreign-born women and among women with lower educational attainment and of "other" race/ethnicity. Conclusions. Strategies to improve Pap test use include (1) educational campaigns that inform women of cervical cancer risk factors and encourage screening and (2) increased support for programs that expand access to Pap tests.

Abstract: Objectives. A community trial was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of the North Carolina Breast Cancer Screening Program, a lay health advisor network intervention intended to increase screening among rural African American women 50 years and older. Methods. A stratified random sample of 801 African American women completed baseline (1993-1994) and follow-up (1996-1997) surveys. The primary outcome was self-reported mammography use in the previous 2 years. Results. The intervention was associated with an overall 6 percentage point increase (95% confidence interval [Cl]=-1;14) in communitywide mammography use. Low-income women in intervention counties showed an 11 percentage point increase (95% Cl=2, 21) in use above that exhibited by low-income women in comparison counties. Adjustment for potentially confounding characteristics did not change the results. Conclusions. A lay health advisor intervention appears to be an effective public health approach to increasing use of screening mammography among low-income, rural populations.

Abstract: Objectives. This project used a long-term, multi-method approach to study the impact of Medicaid managed care. Methods. Survey techniques measured impacts on individuals, and ethnographic methods assessed effects on safety-net providers in New Mexico. Results. After the first year of Medicaid managed care, uninsured adults reported less access and use (odds ratio [OR] = 0.46; 95% confidence interval [Cl] = 0.34, 0.64) and worse barriers to care (OR = 6.60; 95% Cl = 3.95, 11.54) than adults in other insurance categories. Medicaid children experienced greater access and use (OR = 2.11; 95% Cl = 1.21, 3.72) and greater communication and satisfaction (OR= 3.64; 95% Cl = 1.13, 12.54) than children in other insurance categories; uninsured children encountered greater barriers to care (OR = 6.29; 95% Cl = 1.58, 42.21). There were no consistent changes in the major outcome variables over the period of transition to Medicaid managed care. Safety-net institutions experienced marked increases in workload and financial stress, especially in rural areas. Availability of mental health services declined sharply. Providers worked to buffer the impact of Medicaid managed care for patients. Conclusions. In its first year, Medicaid managed care exerted major effects on safety-net providers but relatively few measurable effects on individuals. This reform did not address the problems of the uninsured.

Abstract: This commentary presents an "indigenist" model of Native women's health, a stress-coping paradigm that situates Native women's health within the larger context of their status as a colonized people. The model is grounded in empirical evidence that traumas such as the "soul wound" of historical and contemporary discrimination among Native women influence health and mental health outcomes. The preliminary model also incorporates cultural resilience, including as moderators identity, enculturation, spiritual coping, and traditional healing practices. Current epidemiological data on Native women's general health and mental health are reconsidered within the framework of this model.

Abstract: Objectives. We evaluated risk for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in women residing in low-income neighborhoods of northern California. Methods. A population-based sample of 1707 women, aged 18 to 29, were surveyed and screened for sexually transmitted infections and HCV. Results. Women infected with HCV (2.5%) were more likely to have a history of injection and noninjection drug use, to exchange sex for money or drugs, and to have sexually transmitted infections. HCV was independently associated with history of injection drug use, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection, and heroin and cocaine use. Conclusions. Injection drug use is the highest risk exposure for HCV, but HSV-2 and noninjection drug use contribute significantly to increased risk. HCV prevention programs in impoverished areas should integrate drug treatment and sexually transmitted infection control.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined predictors of longevity in a cohort of inner-city African American women. Methods. Data were derived from a cohort study of inner-city African American mothers whose median age in 1966 was 31 years. Analyses involved single-decrement life tables and pooled logistic regression. Results. Giving birth for the first time before age 25 and having at least a high school education predicted longevity in this sample. Effects of later age at first delivery in terms of mortality risk were stronger after 55 years and, especially, after 70 years. Conclusions. The findings offer support for Geronimus's weathering hypothesis. Predictors of longevity among African Americans may be distinct from predictors for the population as a whole.

Abstract: In this commentary, we focus on violence against women of color. Although African American women experience higher rates of intimate partner homicide than White women, the cumulative rates for nonfatal intimate partner violence are similar and do not vary between urban and rural locations (though access to services may vary by location). Much of the research about intimate partner violence is based on women with low socioeconomic status and on interventions that were developed by and for White women. Current primary prevention strategies focus on violence that is perpetrated by strangers rather than their primary perpetrators-intimate partners. We recommend the development and rigorous evaluation of prevention strategies that incorporate the views of women of color and attention to primary prevention.

Abstract: The US Department of Health and Human Services has developed an initiative called "Eliminating Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health," which parallels Healthy People 2010, the nation's health goals for the next decade. The initiative focuses on areas of health disparity that are known to affect racially and ethnically diverse groups of the population yet hold the promise of improvement. The first step to addressing such health inequities is to understand the scope and nature of the diseases that contribute to such disparities. This commentary reviews the epidemiology and consequences of type 2 diabetes, particularly as it is manifested in socially and culturally diverse groups, and offers recommendations for actions to address the disparities resulting from diabetes.

Abstract: Much of the research on women's health has not deepened our understanding of health issues affecting Latinas. Yet integration of research on Latinas into the women's health agenda is important for at least 2 reasons. First, critical public health issues facing Latinas must be better understood if effective interventions designed to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in health are to be developed and implemented. Second, studies on the health of Latinas represent unique opportunities to advance scientific understandings of underlying processes relevant to the health of other populations. Such research can further our knowledge of the processes underlying cultural adaptation and negotiation of changing sex roles and how these issues affect the health of women. Critical research and empirical approaches that help us to understand how race, ethnicity, sex, and class shape the health of Latinas will inform broader public health issues.

Abstract: Despite all the gains that have been made in the area of breast cancer research, African American women suffer disproportionately from the effects of the disease. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among African American women, exceeded only by lung cancer. Improvements in cancer incidence, mortality, and survival rates among populations are undoubtedly the outcome of quality research. Therefore, there is a need to identify and discuss issues regarding breast cancer among African American women and to determine whether these issues should be a part of the nation's breast cancer research agenda. This commentary summarizes the results of the Summit Meeting Evaluating Research on Breast Cancer in African American Women, which was held September 8-11, 2000, in Washington, DC. Listed are priority areas and some of the questions that fueled this 2-day discussion among 130 participants, including health advocates, cancer survivors, and experts representing various areas of cancer research.

Abstract: Objectives. We investigated history of abuse and other HIV-related risk factors in a community sample of 490 HIV-positive and HIV-negative African American, European American, and Latina women. Methods. Baseline interviews were analyzed, and logistic regressions were used to identify predictors of risk for positive HIV serostatus overall and by racial/ethnic group. Results. Race/ethnicity was not an independent predictor of HIV-related risk, and few racial/ethnic differences in risk factors for HIV were seen. Regardless of race/ethnicity, HIV-positive women had more sexual partners, more sexually transmitted diseases, and more severe histories of abuse than did HIV-negative women. Trauma history was a general risk factor for women, irrespective of race/ethnicity. Conclusions. Limited material resources, exposure to violence, and high-risk sexual behaviors were the best predictors of HIV risk.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined whether individual (self-perceived) and institutional (segregation and redlining) racial discrimination was associated with poor health status among members of an ethnic group. Methods. Adult respondents (n = 1503) in the cross-sectional Chinese American Psychiatric Epidemiologic Study were geocoded to the 1990 census and the 1995 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act database. Hierarchical linear modeling assessed the relationship between discrimination and scores on the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 and revised Symptom Checklist 90 health status measures. Results. Individual and institutional measures of racial discrimination were associated with health status after control for acculturation, sex, age, social support, income, health insurance, employment status, education, neighborhood poverty, and housing value. Conclusions. The data support the hypothesis that discrimination at multiple levels influences the health of minority group members.

Abstract: Objectives. This study compared HIV-associated sexual health history, risk perceptions, and sexual risk behaviors of low-income rural and nonrural African American women. Methods. A cross-sectional statewide survey of African American women (n = 571) attending federally funded Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children clinics was conducted. Results. Adjusted analyses indicated that rural women were more likely to report not being counseled about HIV during pregnancy (P = .001), that a sex partner had not been tested for HIV (P = .005), no preferred method of prevention because they did not worry about sexually transmitted diseases (P = .02), not using condoms (P = .009), and a belief that their partner was HIV negative, despite lack of testing (P = .04). Conclusions. This study provided initial evidence that low-income rural African American women are an important population for HIV prevention programs.

Abstract: Many believe that the United States has entered a "Golden Age" of cardiovascular health and medicine. Pharmacological and technological advances have indeed produced an era of declining mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases for the nation as a whole. However, there remain areas of challenge. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is still by far the leading cause of death and disability in the United States, and it is the leading killer of US women. Perhaps the single most notable feature of the CVD epidemic in the United States is the substantial difference in morbidity and mortality that exists between White women and women of color, with a disproportionate share of suffering borne by minority women. Unexplained regional variations also cloud the otherwise notable progress of the last 30 years, and many rural areas appear to be uniquely affected by cardiovascular disease. This commentary reviews the evidence that the CVD epidemic disproportionately burdens women of color who reside in rural areas, itemizes and provides a logical framework for explaining this burden, and suggests approaches to solving this vexing public health problem.

Abstract: This article provides an overview of the magnitude of and trends in racial/ethnic disparities in health for women in the United States. It emphasizes the importance of attending to diversity in the health profiles and populations of minority women. Socioeconomic status is a central determinant of racial/ethnic disparities in health, but several other factors, including medical care, geographic location, migration and acculturation, racism, and exposure to stress and resources also play a role. There is a need for renewed attention to monitoring, understanding, and actively seeking to eliminate racial/ethnic disparities in health.

Issue: 4
Pages: 561-564
Abstract: Although community-based research is intended to be culturally sensitive, more advanced consideration of the impact of race, gender, and class is needed for health disparity research involving women of color. Research processes must permit the simultaneous disclosures of the racial, gender, and class identities among women of color that are assumed and imposed. The authoritative knowledge that women of color have about their lives and their health should form the basis for collaboration between researchers and study participants. The dissemination of research findings to study participants, and dialogue on those findings, is imperative for the development of sustainable interventions.

Abstract: Objectives. This study measured age-specific seroprevalence of HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among injection drug users (IDUs) admitted to drug treatment programs in 6 US cities. Methods. Remnant sera collected from persons entering treatment with a history of illicit drug injection were tested for antibodies to HIV, hepatitis C (anti-HCV), and hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Results. Prevalence of anti-HBc and anti-HCV increased with age and reached 80% to 100% among older IDUs in all 6 cities. Although overall age-specific HIV prevalence was lower than anti-HCV or anti-HBc, this prevalence was greater in the Northeast than in the Midwest and West. Conclusions. The need continues for effective primary prevention programs among IDUs specifically targeting young persons who have recently started to inject drugs.

Volume: 92

Pages: 347-351
Abstract: Since 1999, many african governments have launched programs to offer short-course antiretroviral drug regimens to reduce mother-to child transmission of hiv. Hiv testing in prenatal care is the gateway to these antiretroviral regimens. Pilot projects in africa show an uptake of antiretroviral drugs in 8% to 50% of pregnant women presumed to be hiv infected; often, a minority of eligible women in care received these regimens. Use of lay counselors and rapid onsite hiv testing may alleviate health service barriers. Community education to promote voluntary counseling and testing, which involves men, is the long-term solution. In the short term, possibilities to enhance delivery of an effective intervention include group pretest counseling, universal offer of testing with women having the right to "opt out," universal treatment (mass treatment for those whose hiv status is not determined by voluntary counseling and testing), universal testing with women having the right to "opt out" of learning their test results, and mass treatment for all without testing.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the characteristics, activities, and challenges of high-risk informal caregivers. Methods. Telephone interviews were conducted with a nationally representative cross-section of 1002 informal caregivers. Vulnerable caregivers with poor health or a serious health condition were compared with nonvulnerable caregivers. Results. Thirty-six percent of caregivers were vulnerable. Compared with nonvulnerable caregivers, vulnerable caregivers were more likely to have difficulty providing care, to provide higher-intensity care, to report that their physical health had suffered since becoming a caregiver, to be aged 65 years or older, to be married, and to have less than 12 years of education. Conclusions. Reliance on informal caregivers without considering the caregiver's ability to provide care can create a stressful and potentially unsafe environment for the caregiver and the care recipient.

Statistical and spatial correlations between the 6 indices were computed for individual South Carolina facilities. Results. Although the 6 toxicity indices are not highly correlated in theory, they have more commonality in practice. There was significant spatial variation in the indices by individual facility level. Conclusions. Environmental justice researchers must be cognizant of differences in toxicity indices because the choice of the toxicity measure can alter (statistically and spatially) the results of equity analyses and lead to erroneous conclusions.

Issue: 3

Abstract: In spite of recent advances in treatment and care available in most developed countries, the HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to spread throughout the developing world. Structural inequalities continue to fuel the epidemic in all societies, and HIV infection has increasingly been concentrated in the poorest, most marginalized sectors of society in all countries. The relationship between HIV/AIDS and social and economic development has therefore become a central point in policy discussions about the most effective responses to the epidemic. Important progress has been made in recent United Nations initiatives. Maintaining long-term commitment to initiatives such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is especially important in the wake of September 11 and ensuing events, which threaten to redirect necessary resources to seemingly more urgent security concerns.

Abstract: Objectives. This study sought to determine the relationships between race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and cardiovascular health behaviors among youths and whether neighborhood characteristics are associated with such behaviors independently of individual characteristics. Methods. Linear models determined the effects of individual and neighborhood characteristics (SES, social disorganization, racial/ethnic minority concentration, urbanization) on dietary habits, physical activity, and smoking among 8165 youths aged 12 to 21 years. Results. Low SES was associated with poorer dietary habits, less physical activity, and higher odds of smoking. After adjustment for SES, Black race was associated with poorer dietary habits and lower odds of smoking. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with healthier dietary habits, lower levels of physical activity, and lower odds of smoking than non-Hispanic ethnicity. Low neighborhood SES and high neighborhood social disorganization were independently associated with poorer dietary habits, while high neighborhood Hispanic concentration and urbanicity were associated with healthier dietary habits. Neighborhood characteristics were not associated with physical activity or smoking. Conclusions. Changes in neighborhood social structures and policies that reduce social inequalities may enhance cardiovascular health behaviors.

Abstract: Objectives. This study explored differences between refusers and participants in a longitudinal study with extensive baseline and follow-up information. Methods. Results of a trial comparing 791 participants and 401 community-residing older adults who refused to participate in a study concerning preventive home visits were examined. Information was collected from interviews, insurance records, and government files. Results. Despite similarities in terms of age, sex, and self-perceived health at baseline, 3-year follow-up data indicated that refusers had a 1.58-fold higher risk of entering a nursing home than participants. There were additional differences between refusers and participants when refusers were categorized in 4 subgroups based on self-reported reason for refusal (too ill, too healthy, no interest, and other reasons). Conclusions. Future studies should include follow-up data to allow comparisons between refusers and participants and should address the presence of multiple subgroups of refusers.

Seroprevalence (initially 60.5% vs 48.3%) declined approximately 15% in both groups, remaining higher among those who have sex with men. Generally, injection prevalence, but not sexual risk behaviors, declined. Conclusions. Male IDUs who have sex with men are more likely to engage in higher-risk behaviors and to be HIV infected. Improved intervention approaches for male IDUs who have sex with men are needed.

Title: Corporate speech and the constitution: The deregulation of tobacco advertising
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Gostin, L.O.
Year: 2002
Volume: 92
Issue: 3
Pages: 352-355
Abstract: In a series of recent cases, the Supreme Court has given businesses powerful new First Amendment rights to advertise hazardous products. Most recently, in Lorillard Tobacco Co v Reilly (121 SCt 2404 [2001]), the court invalidated Massachusetts regulations intended to reduce underage smoking. The future prospects for commercial speech regulation appear dim, but the reasoning in commercial speech cases is supported by only a plurality of the court. A different First Amendment theory should recognize the importance of population health and the low value of corporate speech. In particular, a future court should consider the low informational value of tobacco advertising, the availability of alternative channels of communication, the unlawful practice of targeting minors, and the magnitude of the social harms.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined effects of racial/ethnic misclassification of American Indians and Alaskan natives on Washington State death certificates. Methods. Probabilistic record linkage were used to match the 1989-1997 state death files to the Northwest Tribal Registry. Results. We identified matches for 2819 decedents, including 414 (14.7%) who had been misclassified as non-American Indians and Alaskan natives on the death certificates. The likelihood of being correctly classified increased 3-fold for each higher level of American Indian and Alaskan native ancestry (odds ratio = 2.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.51, 3.30) and decreased by 6.9% per calendar year (95% CI = 2.0, 11.5). Conclusions. Systematic biases on death certificates in Washington State persist. Methods to reduce misclassification can improve data quality and enhance efforts to measure and reduce racial/ethnic health disparities.

Abstract: Objectives. This study assessed the countervailing effects on HIV incidence of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) among San Francisco men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods. Behavioral risk was determined on the basis of responses to cross-sectional community interviews. HIV incidence was assessed through application of an enzyme-linked immunoassay testing strategy. Results. Use of HAART among MSM living with AIDS increased from 4% in 1995 to 54% in 1999. The percentage of MSM who reported both unprotected anal intercourse and multiple sexual partners increased from 24% in 1994 to 45% in 1999. The annual HIV incidence rate increased from 2.1% in 1996 to 4.2% in 1999 among MSM who sought anonymous HIV testing, and the rate was high (5.3%) but stable in a blinded survey of MSM seeking sexually transmitted disease services. Conclusions. Any decrease in per contact risk of HIV transmission due to HAART use appears to have been counterbalanced or overwhelmed by increases in the number of unsafe sexual episodes.

Abstract: Objectives. This article describes the tobacco industry's use of bars and nightclubs to encourage smoking among young adults. Methods. Previously secret tobacco industry marketing documents were analyzed. Results. Tobacco industry bar and nightclub promotions in the 1980s and 1990s included aggressive advertising, tobacco brand-sponsored activities, and distribution of samples, Financial incentives for Club owners and staff were used to encourage smoking through peer influence. Increased use of these strategies occurred concurrently with an increase in smoking among persons aged 18 through 24 years. Conclusions. The tobacco industry's bar and nightclub promotions are not yet politically controversial and are not regulated by the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement between the industry and the states. Tobacco control advocates should include young adults in research and advocacy efforts and should design interventions to counter this industry strategy to solidify smoking patterns and recruit young adult smokers.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined trends in health insurance coverage for health care workers and their children between 1988 and 1998. Methods. We analyzed data from the annual March supplements of the Current Population Survey (CPS), a Census Bureau survey that collects information about health insurance from a nationally representative sample of noninstitutionalized US residents. Results. Of the health care personnel younger than 65 years, 1.36 million (90% confidence interval [Cl] = 1.28 million, 1.45 million) were uninsured in 1998, up 83.4% from 1988; the proportion uninsured rose from 8.4% (90% Cl = 7.8%, 9.1%) to 12.2% (90% Cl = 11.5%, 12.9%). Declining coverage rates in the growing private-sector health care workforce-and declining health employment in the public sector, which provided health insurance benefits to more of its workers-accounted for the increases. Households with a health care worker included 1.12 million (90% Cl = 1.05 million, 1.20 million) uninsured children, accounting for 10.1% (90% Cl = 9.5%, 10.8%) of all uninsured children in the United States. Conclusions. Health care personnel are losing health insurance coverage more rapidly than are other workers. Increasingly, the health care sector is consigning its own workers and their children to the ranks of the uninsured.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the relationship between timing of insurance coverage and prenatal care among low-income women. Methods. Timeliness of prenatal care initiation and adequacy of number of visits were studied among 5455 low-income participants in a larger cross-sectional statewide survey of postpartum women in California during 1994-1995. Results. Although only 2% of women remained uninsured throughout pregnancy, one fifth lacked coverage during the first trimester. Rates of untimely care were highest (≥64%) among women who were uninsured throughout their pregnancy or whose coverage began after the first trimester; rates were lowest (about 10%) among women who obtained coverage during the first trimester. Women who first obtained Medi-Cal coverage during pregnancy were at low risk of having too few visits. Conclusions. Timing of prenatal coverage should be considered in research on the relationship between coverage and care use among low-income women. Earlier studies that relied solely on principal payer information, without data on when coverage began, may have led to inaccurate inferences about lack of coverage as a barrier to prenatal care.

Abstract: Objectives. A population-based Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) Index was developed in New York City to identify geographic areas and subpopulations at increased risk for PCP. Methods. A zip code-level PCP Index was created from AIDS surveillance and hospital discharge records and defined as (number of PCP-related hospitalizations)/(number of persons living with AIDS). Results. In 1997, there were 2262 hospitalizations for PCP among 39 740 persons living with AIDS in New York City (PCP Index = .05691). PCP Index values varied widely across neighborhoods with high AIDS prevalence (West Village = .02532 vs Central Harlem = .08696). Some neighborhoods with moderate AIDS prevalence had strikingly high rates (Staten Island = .14035; northern Manhattan = .08756). Conclusions. The PCP Index highlights communities in particular need of public health interventions to improve HIV-related service delivery.

Abstract: Objectives. This study tested whether collocation of Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) clinics at managed care provider sites improved health care for infants enrolled in Medicaid and WIC. Methods. Weights and immunization rates were studied for the 1997 birth cohort of African American infants enrolled in WIC and Medicaid in Detroit, Mich. Infants using traditional WIC clinics and health services were compared with those enrolled under Medicaid in 2 managed care organizations (MCOs), of whom about half obtained WIC services at MCO provider sites. Results. Compared with other infants, those who used collocated WIC sites either were closer to their age-appropriate weight or had higher immunization rates when recertified by WIC after their first birthday. Specific benefits (weight gain or immunizations) varied according to the priorities at the collocated sites operated by the 2 MCOs. Conclusions. Collocation of WIC clinics at MCO sites can improve health care of low-income infants. However specific procedures for cooperation between WIC staff and other MCO staff are required to achieve this benefit.

Abstract: Objectives. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationships between stigma and shame associated with seeking treatment for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and undergoing testing for gonorrhea and HIV. Methods. Participants were 847 males and 1126 females (mean age: 24.9 years) in 7 cities. Two scales assessed STD-related stigma and STD-related shame. Results. Rates of stigma and shame were higher among participants without a gonorrhea test in the past year and among those without an HIV test. Sex, age, health service use, previous suspicion of gonorrhea, and low levels of stigma were independently associated with gonorrhea testing. Age, enrollment site, use of health services, gonorrhea testing, and low levels of stigma were independently associated with HIV testing. Conclusions. Shame is part of the experience of seeking STD-related care, but stigma may be a more powerful barrier to obtaining such care.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined whether the change in nicotine replacement therapy sales from prescription to over the counter (OTC) status affected smoking cessation. Methods. We used the 1993-1999 Massachusetts Tobacco Surveys to compare data from adult current smokers and recent quitters before and after the OTC switch. Results. No significant change over time occurred in the proportion of smokers who used nicotine replacement therapy at a quit attempt in the past year (20.1% pre-OTC vs 21.4% post-OTC), made a quit attempt in the past year (48.1% vs 45.2%), or quit smoking in the past year (8.1% vs 11.1%). Fewer non-Whites used nicotine replacement therapy after the switch (20.7% pre-OTC vs 3.2% post-OTC, P = .002), but the proportion of Whites using nicotine replacement therapy did not change significantly (20.6% vs 24.0%). Conclusions. We observed no increase in Massachusetts smokers' rates of using nicotine replacement therapy, making a quit attempt, or stopping smoking after nicotine replacement therapy became available for OTC sale. There appear to be other barriers to the use of nicotine replacement therapy besides visiting a physician, especially among minority smokers.

Author-Name: Manfredi, C.P.

Volume: 92
Issue: 3
Pages: 360-362
Abstract: In 1989, Canada enacted the Tobacco Products Control Act (TPCA), which prohibited tobacco advertising, required health warnings on tobacco packaging, and restricted promotional activities. Canada's tobacco companies challenged the TPCA's constitutionality, arguing that it infringed on freedom of expression. Although it seemed likely that the Canadian Supreme Court would uphold the legislation, in 1995 the court declared the impugned provisions to be unconstitutional. The decision is testimony to the constraining force of liberalism on tobacco regulation, but it is also evidence of the power of political will. While the Canadian government could have used the decision to justify withdrawing from further confrontations with powerful commercial interests, it chose instead to enact new tobacco control legislation in 1997.

Abstract: Objectives. This study evaluated the validity of concerns about the toxicity of nevirapine (NVP) that have delayed its implementation as a perinatal HIV prevention strategy. Methods. A decision analysis model compared 3 strategies: single-dose NVP, short-course zidovudine (ZDV), and no intervention. Results. NVP would prevent more deaths than ZDV and no intervention as long as the rate of NVP toxicity did not exceed, respectively, 9 times that observed in the earlier NVP clinical trial and 42 times that observed in the clinical trial. NVP would be economically preferable to ZDV as long as the rate of toxicity did not exceed 22 times that observed in the clinical trial. Conclusions. Field implementation of NVP should not be delayed by concerns about its toxicity.

Abstract: Objectives. This study assessed the prevalence of AIDS stigma and misinformation about HIV transmission in 1997 and 1999 and examined trends in stigma in the United States during the 1990s. Methods. Telephone surveys with national probability samples of English-speaking adults were conducted in the period 1996 to 1997 (n = 1309) and in 1998 to 1999 (n = 669). Findings were compared with results from a similar 1991 survey. Results. Overt expressions of stigma declined throughout the 1990s, with support for its most extreme and coercive forms (e.g., quarantine) at very low levels by 1999. However, inaccurate beliefs about the risks posed by casual social contact increased, as did the belief that people with AIDS (PWAs) deserve their illness. In 1999, approximately one third of respondents expressed discomfort and negative feelings toward PWAs. Conclusions. Although support for extremely punitive policies toward PWAs has declined, AIDS remains a stigmatized condition in the United States. The persistence of discomfort with PWAs, blame directed at PWAs for their condition, and misapprehensions about casual social contact are cause for continuing concern and should be addressed in HIV prevention and education programs.

Author-Name: Derickson, A.

Volume: 92
Issue: 2
Pages: 180-190
Abstract: The public health community has made important, original contributions to the debate over universal access to health services in the United States. Well before the decision of the American Public Health Association in 1944 to endorse a health plan encompassing virtually the entire populace, prominent public health practitioners and scholars embraced universality as an essential principle of health policy. Influenced by Arthur Newsholme, C.-E. A. Winslow began to promote this principle in the 1920s. Many others came to justify universal medical care as a corollary of the traditional ideal of all-inclusive public health services. By the 1940s, most leaders in the field saw national health insurance as the best way to attain universal access. For the past 30 years, advocates of universalism have asserted a social right to health services.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the effect of program format and incentives on participation and cessation in worksite smoking cessation programs. Methods. Twenty-four worksites were randomized to 6 conditions that differed in cessation program format and the use of incentives. Programs were offered for 18 months in each worksite. A total of 2402 cigarette smokers identified at baseline were surveyed 12 and 24 months later to assess participation in programs and cessation. Results. A total of 407 (16.9%) of the smoker cohort registered for programs; on the 12- and 24-month surveys, 15.4% and 19.4% of the cohort, respectively, reported that they had not smoked in the previous 7 days. Registration for programs in incentive sites was almost double that of no-incentive sites (22.4% vs 11.9%), but increased registration did not translate into significantly greater cessation rates. Program type did not affect registration or cessation rates. Conclusions. Although incentives increase rates of registration in worksite smoking cessation programs, they do not appear to increase cessation rates. Phone counseling seems to be at least as effective as group programs for promoting smoking cessation in worksites.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the prevalence of AIDS-related risk behaviors among adolescent males with female, male, and both-sex sexual partners and explored factors related to these behaviors. Methods. Three waves of a population-based survey provided data on male high school students: 3065 with only female sexual partners, 94 with only male partners, and 108 with both. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine AIDS-related outcomes. Results. Youths with any same-sex experience reported less school AIDS education. Bisexual experience predicted multiple sexual partners, unprotected intercourse, sexually transmitted disease, and injection drug use. School AIDS education and condom instruction predicted less AIDS-related risk. Conclusions. Bisexually active adolescent males report especially high levels of AIDS risk behavior. School-based AIDS prevention should address the needs of all sexually active youths.

Abstract: Objectives. This study estimated the prevalence of medication treatment for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among elementary school children in a North Carolina county. Methods. Parents of 7333 children in grades 1 through 5 in 17 public elementary schools were asked whether their child had ever been given a diagnosis of ADHD by a psychologist or physician and whether their child was currently taking medication to treat ADHD. Parents of 6099 children (83%) responded. Results. By parental report, 607 children (10%) had been given an ADHD diagnosis and 434 (7%) were receiving ADHD medication treatment. Seventy-one % of the diagnosed children were receiving medication. Treatment rates varied by sex, race/ethnicity, and grade. Conclusions. If treatment patterns observed in this study are representative, the public health impact of ADHD may be underestimated.

Abstract: Objectives. This study explored the recognition and treatment of osteoporosis and vertebral fracture among older women by primary care physicians. Methods. Data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 1993 to 1997 were examined for evidence of diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis or vertebral fracture during visits by White women 60 years and older to primary care physicians. Results. Fewer than 2% of the women received diagnoses of osteoporosis or vertebral fracture, although expected prevalence is 20% to 30%. Appropriate drug treatment, including antiresorptive agents and calcium and vitamin D, was offered to only 36% of the diagnosed patients. Conclusions. Few cases of osteoporosis or vertebral fracture in older women are being diagnosed and treated by primary care physicians.

Abstract: Objectives. This study sought to provide a characterization of US childhood vaccination providers. Methods. The state was used as the analytic unit in examining 1997 data from the National Immunization Survey and the Vaccines for Children program, state immunization reports, and natality records. Results. Overall, 57% of children were vaccinated in the private sector, 18% were vaccinated in the public sector, and 25% were vaccinated by a mixture of providers. Of the 50883 immunization sites, 81% were private and 19% public. Average patient load was 77 infants per site. Private-sector patient loads were lower than public-sector loads. Conclusions. US childhood vaccination provider capacity is adequate. Efforts to raise coverage rates should focus on increasing preventive care use among children, improving the vaccination performance of providers, and ensuring continuity of care.

Abstract: Objectives. Nationally representative data were used to examine associations of romantic attractions and relationships with substance use and abuse. Methods. Data from the Add Health Study were examined. Youths reporting same-sex and both-sex romantic attractions and relationships were compared with those reporting opposite-sex attractions. Survey regression and logistic regression were used to control for sample design effects. Results. In the case of certain outcomes, romantic attraction affected males differently than females. Youths with both-sex attractions were at a somewhat higher risk for substance use and abuse than were heterosexual youths; females with same-sex attractions were also at higher risk for some outcomes. Sexual-minority youths varied little from heterosexual youths in regard to trajectories of substance use and abuse. Conclusions. These findings highlight the importance of distinguishing between youths with only same-sex attractions and those with both-sex attractions. These findings also call into question previous findings indicating that sexual-minority youths are automatically "at risk.".

Abstract: Objectives. This study sought to describe condom use over time in new and established adolescent relationships. Methods. The outcome variable was time (in days) until first unprotected coital event. Analyses involved comparisons of Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards models. Results. Survival functions for the 2 relationship groups were significantly different. However, by 21 days the curves had converged: 43% of new and 41% of established relationships involved no unprotected coital events. Time to first unprotected coital event was significantly longer in new than in established relationships. Conclusions. Prolongation of condom use in ongoing relationships may be a useful intervention to prevent sexually transmitted diseases.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the relative perceived effectiveness of 30 antidrug public service announcements (PSAs) and assessed the extent to which judgments of effectiveness are related to judgments of realism, amount learned, and positive and negative emotional responses. Methods. Data were obtained from 3608 students in grades 5 through 12 in 10 schools. The ethnically diverse sample was 50,8% male. Students in 5 experimental conditions viewed sets of 6 antidrug PSAs and filled out a brief evaluation questionnaire following each PSA. Those in the control condition viewed a non-drug-related television program. Results. The relative perceived effectiveness of the 30 PSAs varied considerably. Sixteen were rated as significantly more effective, and 6 as significantly less effective, than the control program. Relative rated effectiveness was highly related to realism (r=.87), amount learned (r=.88), negative emotion (r=.87), and positive emotion (r=-.35). Conclusions. Evaluative research is necessary to prevent broadcast of PSAs that could have a negative impact. PSAs should point out the negative consequences of drug use behavior rather than telling adolescents to "just say no.".

Abstract: Objectives. This study assessed the differential effects of face-to-face interviewing and audio-computer assisted self-interviewing (audio-CASI) on categories of questions. Methods. Syringe exchange program participants (n = 1417) completed face-to-face interviews or audio-CASI. The questionnaire was categorized into the groups "stigmatized behaviors," "neutral behaviors," and "psychological distress." Interview modes were compared for questions from each category. Results. Audio-CASI elicited more frequent reporting of "stigmatized behaviors" than face-to-face interviews. Face-to-face interviewing elicited more frequent reporting of "psychological distress" than audio-CASI. Conclusions. Responding to potentially sensitive questions should not be seen as merely "providing data," but rather as an activity with complex motivations. These motivations can include maintaining social respect, obtaining social support, and altruism. Ideally, procedures for collecting self-report data would maximize altruistic motivation while accommodating the other motives.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the differential effects of poverty on the mental health of foreign-born children, Canadian-born children of immigrant parents, and children of nonimmigrant parents. Methods. Secondary analysis of data from a national Canadian study of children between 4 and 11 years of age was conducted. Results. Compared with their receiving-society counterparts, foreign-born children were more than twice as likely to live in poor families, but they had lower levels of emotional and behavioral problems. The effect of poverty on children's mental health among long-term immigrant and receiving-society families was indirect and primarily mediated by single-parent status, ineffective parenting, parental depression, and family dysfunction. In comparison, the mental health effect of poverty among foreign-born children could not be explained by the disadvantages that poor families often suffer. Conclusions. Poverty may represent a transient and inevitable part of the resettlement process for new immigrant families. For long-stay immigrant and receiving-society families, however, poverty probably is not part of an unfolding process; instead, it is the nadir of a cycle of disadvantage.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined voluntary HIV testing rates in sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics. Methods. Anonymous, unlinked surveys of HIV seroprevalence and medical chart abstractions were conducted in 28 STD clinics in 14 US cities in 1997. Results. Among the 52 260 patients included in the anonymous HIV serosurveys, voluntary HIV testing rates by clinic ranged from 30% to 99% (median = 58%). Patients not tested were more likely to be HIV infected than were patients who were tested, even after those with documented HIV infection were excluded, regardless of demographic characteristics, risk group, or STD diagnosis. Conclusions. HIV infection is unrecognized in substantial numbers of patients with HIV infection visiting STD clinics. Efforts are needed to increase HIV testing and counseling of all patients visiting these clinics.

Abstract: Objectives. Because larger food portions could be contributing to the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity, this study was designed to weigh samples of marketplace foods, identify historical changes in the sizes of those foods, and compare current portions with federal standards. Methods. We obtained information about current portions from manufacturers or from direct weighing; we obtained information about past portions from manufacturers or contemporary publications. Results. Marketplace food portions have increased in size and now exceed federal standards. Portion sizes began to grow in the 1970s, rose sharply in the 1980s, and have continued in parallel with increasing body weights. Conclusions. Because energy content increases with portion size, educational and other public health efforts to address obesity should focus on the need for people to consume smaller portions.

Abstract: Objectives. This investigation examined the effectiveness of intensive efforts to include frequently absent students in order to reduce bias in classroom-based studies. Methods. Grade 10 students in 13 New York City high schools (n=2049) completed self-administered confidential surveys in 4 different phases: a 1-day classroom capture, a 1-day follow-up, and 2 separate 1-week follow-ups. Financial incentives were offered, along with opportunities for out-of-classroom participation. Results. Findings showed that frequently absent students engaged in more risk behaviors than those who were rarely absent. Intensive efforts to locate and survey chronically absent students did not, however, significantly alter estimates of risk behavior. Weighting the data for individual absences marginally improved the estimates. Conclusions. This study showed that intensive efforts to capture absent students in classroom-based investigations are not warranted by the small improvements produced in regard to risk behavior estimates.

Abstract: Objectives. Prenatal iron supplementation has been the standard recommendation for reducing maternal anemia in developing countries for the past 30 years. This article reviews the efficacy of iron supplementation on hemoglobin levels in pregnant women in developing countries. Methods. Data from randomized controlled trials published between 1966 and 1998 were pooled. Meta-analyses of the relative change in maternal hemoglobin associated with iron supplementation were stratified by initial hemoglobin levels, duration of supplementation, and daily gestational supplement dose and supplementation with other nutrients. Results. Iron supplementation raises hemoglobin levels. Its effects are dose dependent and are related to initial hematologic status. The extent to which iron supplementation can reduce maternal anemia is unclear. Conclusions. The extent to which maternal hemoglobin levels can be increased by recommended prenatal supplementation is limited and has uncertain physiological benefits. Other approaches, including food fortification and prevention and treatment of other causes of anemia, require methodologically rigorous evaluation to find effective answers to this global problem.

Abstract: Objectives. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of iron status on cadmium dose among pregnant women. Methods. Iron status and cadmium concentration in blood, urine, and placenta were determined among women followed for 2 years from early pregnancy. Results. Blood cadmium and urinary cadmium were correlated with iron status throughout the study period. Urinary cadmium increased longitudinally among women with exhausted iron stores during their pregnancy. The increase in urinary cadmium with age was more pronounced in multiparous than in nulliparous women. Conclusions. Iron deficiency during pregnancy leads to increased cadmium absorption and body burden. Multiparous women exhibit additional increases with increasing age.

We administered a survey to 143 parents of children aged 3 to 16 years with asthma or sickle cell anemia in 2 clinical settings. Results. Respondents indicated incomplete knowledge of work requirements (69.9%) and work exemptions (50.3%). Applications for work exemptions were rare, even among Supplemental Security Income recipients (30%). Conclusions. Welfare beneficiaries with children who have chronic conditions show limited knowledge and use of program provisions, placing them at risk for penalties or benefit termination.

Abstract: Objectives. This study sought to determine the tobacco industry's strategies for opposing health board actions and to identify elements necessary for public health to prevail. Methods. Newspaper articles, personal interviews, and tobacco industry documents released through litigation were reviewed. Results. Twenty-five instances in which the tobacco industry opposed health board regulations were identified. It was shown that the tobacco industry uses 3 strategies against health boards: "accommodation" (tobacco industry public relations campaigns to accommodate smokers in public places), legislative intervention, and litigation. These strategies are often executed with the help of tobacco industry front groups or allies in the hospitality industry. Conclusions. Although many tobacco control advocates believe that passing health board regulations is easier than the legislative route, this is generally not the case. The industry will often attempt to involve the legislature in fighting the regulations, forcing advocates to fight a battle on 2 fronts. It is important for health boards to verify their authority over smoking restrictions and refrain from considering nonhealth factors (including industry claims of adverse economic impacts) so as to withstand court challenges.

Abstract: In a Black community in Boston, Mass, a community health center developed a faith-based initiative to improve the health of community residents. In partnership with a steering committee composed of community health advocates, church leaders, and community leaders, the community health center planned and implemented annual Health Care Revival meetings at which screening activities and dissemination of health information are integrated with inspirational singing and scripture readings. The success of the Health Care Revival initiative is demonstrated by an increased use of community health center services after each revival meeting, by participants' evaluations, and by an increase in the number of community health improvement projects begun as a direct result of the Health Care Revival initiative.

Abstract: The field of bioethics arose in the late 1960s in response to the emerging ethical dilemmas of that era. The field for many years focused in general on the dilemmas generated by high-technology medicine rather than on issues of population health and the ethical problems of public health programs and regulations. The time has come to more fully integrate the ethical problems of public health into the field of public health and, at the same time, into the field of bioethics. Public health raises a number of moral problems that extend beyond the earlier boundaries of bioethics and require their own form of ethical analysis.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the association between unwanted sexual activity during childhood and risky behaviors among a sample of predominantly African American and Hispanic men. Methods. Data were obtained from baseline interviews completed by 2676 men enrolled in a multisite HIV prevention trial. Results. Approximately 25% of the men reported unwanted or uninvited sexual activity before 13 years of age, with Hispanic men more likely than African American men to report unwanted sexual activity during childhood. Men with a history of unwanted sexual activity during childhood were more likely to report unwanted sexual activity since age 13, the buying and selling of sex, problems with alcohol, and drug use. Men who reported unwanted sexual activity during childhood also reported a significantly greater frequency of unprotected sexual acts and more partners. Conclusions. Among men at high risk for HIV infection, unwanted sexual activity during childhood is more widespread than previously described and can increase the risk of participating in harmful health practices during adulthood, including risky sexual behaviors.

Abstract: Objectives. This study identified mutually exclusive groups of men at high and low risk for use of chewing tobacco and for quitting. Methods. Analyses used a national sample of 1340 non-Hispanic Black, 1358 Mexican American, and 1673 non-Hispanic White men, aged 25 to 64, who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III from 1988 to 1994. Signal detection analysis was used to delineate high- and low-risk subgroups; survival analysis was used to estimate hazard curves for comparing age at onset for chewing tobacco use with that for smoking. Results. Rural, lower-income Black and White men had the highest regular use of chewing tobacco (33.3%), followed by rural, higher-income men regardless of race/ethnicity (14.9%). Southern men who began using chewing tobacco during adulthood had the lowest quit rate (22.5%). In sharp contrast to smoking, chewing tobacco showed a continued onset throughout adulthood. Conclusions. Because subgroups of men show highly different chewing tobacco use and quit rates and because age at chewing tobacco onset occurs across the life span, prevention and cessation programs should be specific to different risk groups and distinct from smoking programs.

Abstract: Objectives. This study sought to determine whether the age at initiation of regular cigarette smoking and the likelihood of quitting smoking through age 35 differ among women from younger versus older generations. Methods. Annual population-based, random surveys (total of 3676 female residents of Geneva, Switzerland, aged 35-74 years) were conducted from 1992 to 1998. Results. Women younger than 55 years were more likely to be past or current smokers, began smoking earlier (median age<20 years), and smoked more cigarettes per day than older women, yet attempted to quit smoking more often before age 35 (log-rank P<.001). Conclusions. Young female smokers have a higher propensity to quit smoking compared with older women. Encouraging young smokers to quit - in addition to preventing nonsmokers from starting - may be an important facet of reducing cigarette smoking prevalence among adolescents.

Abstract: The results of 2 large field studies on the impact of the polio eradication initiative on health systems and 3 supplementary reports were presented at a December 1999 meeting convened by the World Health Organization. All of these studies concluded that positive synergies exist between polio eradication and health systems but that these synergies have not been vigorously exploited. The eradication of polio has probably improved health systems worldwide by broadening distribution of vitamin A supplements, improving cooperation among enterovirus laboratories, and facilitating linkages between health workers and their communities. The results of these studies also show that eliminating polio did not cause a diminution of funding for immunization against other illnesses. Relatively little is known about the opportunity costs of polio eradication. Improved planning in disease eradication initiatives can minimize disruptions in the delivery of other services. Future initiatives should include indicators and baseline data for monitoring effects on health systems development.

Title: Public careers and private sexuality: some gay and lesbian lives in the history of medicine and public health.
Journal: American Journal of Public Health
Author-Name: Hansen, B.
Year: 2002
Volume: 92
Issue: 1
Pages: 36-44
Abstract: This study explores the careers of 5 physicians active in public health and medicine during the first half of the 20th century to illustrate interactions between private and professional life. An examination of these individuals, who might today be variously designated as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or queer, suggests how historical understanding can be enriched by a greater willingness to investigate intimacy and sexual life as potentially relevant to career and achievements. Further, the narratives support a plea for all historians to provide readers with a more frank acknowledgment of the possible relevance of personal life to intellectual work, even in the sciences. Additionally, this historical exploration of ways that careers and achievements may have been affected by a person's homosexuality (even when the person did not publicly embrace a gay identity) opens up a new area of research through biographical sketches based on historical sources combined with generalizations that are intentionally provisional. Included are the stories of Sara Josephine Baker, Harry Stack Sullivan, Ethel Collins Dunham, Martha May Eliot, and Alan L. Hart.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the association between a residential area's socioeconomic status (SES), race, and advanced-stage breast cancer in New York City. Methods. The cross-sectional study design used breast cancer information for 37 921 cases diagnosed in New York City from 1986 to 1995. Residential education and income levels were based on the 1990 census and ascribed to each case by zip code. Associations between race, area SES, and advanced-stage breast cancer stage, and the interaction between race and SES, were evaluated in bivariate and multivariate analyses. Results. After adjusting for age and year at diagnosis, living in areas with lower levels of education and income increased the odds of presenting with advanced-stage breast cancer by 50% for Black women and by 75% for White women. No significant qualitative interaction was present between area SES and race. Conclusions. This study confirmed independent racial and socioeconomic differences in the risk of advanced-stage breast cancer in a large and diverse population. The results emphasize the need to improve screening practices and clinical treatment in both high-risk populations and high-risk geographic areas.

Abstract: Objectives. This study investigated patterns of "doubled-up" homelessness using an indirect measure based on host households. Methods. In random household telephone surveys conducted in Alabama between 1990 and 2000 and nationally in 1997, respondents indicated whether any individual had stayed with them during the past year because that person was homeless. Results. The percentage of Alabama households providing shelter during the past year declined from 16.2% in 1990 to 7.1% in 2000. The national rate for providing shelter in 1997 was 18.0%. Conclusions. Many households provide shelter to people to prevent them from being literally homeless. As the economy has expanded, these rates have declined in Alabama.

Abstract: As government agencies, academic centers, and researchers affiliated with them provide an increasing share of the science base for policy decisions, they are also subject to efforts to politicize or silence objective scientific research. Such actions increasingly use sophisticated and complex strategies that put evidence-based policy making at risk. To assure the appropriate use of scientific evidence and the protection of the scientists who provide it, institutions and individuals must grow more vigilant against these tactics. Maintaining the capacity for evidence-based policy requires differentiating between honest scientific challenge and evident vested interest and responding accordingly, building and diversifying partnerships, assuring the transparency of funding sources, agreeing on rules for publication, and distinguishing the point where science ends and policy begins.

Abstract: Objectives. This study assessed the effectiveness of a sexually transmitted disease (STD)/HIV behavior change intervention in increasing women's use of the female condom. Methods. A total of 604 women at high risk for STDs and HIV in New York City, Baltimore, Md, and Seattle, Wash, enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of a small-group, skills-training intervention that included information and skills training in the use of the female condom. Results. In a logistic regression, the strongest predictors of use were exposure to the intervention (odds ratio [OR] = 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.8, 10.7), intention to use the female condom in the future (OR= 4.5; 95% CI = 2.4, 8.5), having asked a partner to use a condom in the past 30 days (OR= 2.3; 95% CI = 1.3, 3.9), and confidence in asking a partner to use a condom (OR = 1.9; 95% CI= 1.1, 3.5). Conclusions. Clinicians counseling women in the use of the female condom need to provide information, demonstrate its correct use with their clients, and provide an opportunity for their clients to practice skills themselves.

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System was used to obtain state estimates in Iowa. Results. A decreased likelihood of recent checkups was noted for persons aged 25 to 44, men, and those who faced cost barriers. An increased likelihood of recent checkups was associated with married people, highest household income, health insurance, fair and poor health status, physical exercise, occasional smoking, and some chronic diseases. Conclusions. A profile of persons not having a checkup in the past 12 months emerged from the investigation.

Abstract: Objectives. This study determined the age group for the case definition of early adolescent childbearing based on rates of adverse clinical outcomes. Methods. We examined rates of infant mortality, very low birthweight (<1500 g), and very preterm delivery (<32 weeks) per 1000 live births for all US singleton first births (n = 768 029) to women aged 12 to 23 years in the 1995 US birth cohort. Results. Rates of infant mortality, very low birthweight, and very preterm delivery were graphed by maternal age. In all 3 cases, the inflection point below which the rate of poor birth outcome is lower and begins to stabilize is at 16 years; therefore, mothers 15 years and younger were grouped together to determine the case definition of early adolescent childbearing. The inflection points were similar when outcomes were stratified by the 3 largest US racial/ethnic groups (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and Mexican American). Conclusions. From this population-based analysis of birth outcomes, we conclude that early adolescent childbearing is best defined as giving birth at 15 years or younger.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined the justice of decision-making procedures and interpersonal relations as a psychosocial predictor of health. Methods. Regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between levels of perceived justice and self-rated health, minor psychiatric disorders, and recorded absences due to sickness in a cohort of 506 male and 3570 female hospital employees aged 19 to 63 years. Results. The odds ratios of poor self-rated health and minor psychiatric disorders associated with low vs high levels of perceived justice ranged from 1.7 to 2.4. The rates of absence due to sickness among those perceiving low justice were 1.2 to 1.9 times higher than among those perceiving high justice. These associations remained significant after adjustment for behavioral risks, workload, job control, and social support. Conclusions. Low organizational justice is a risk to the health of employees.

Abstract: This study examined (1) the relationship between income inequality and mortality among all counties in the contiguous United States to ascertain whether the relationships found for states and metropolitan areas extend to smaller geographic units and (2) the influence of minority racial concentration on the inequality-mortality linkage. Methods. This county-level ecologic analysis used data from the Compressed Mortality Files and the US Census, Weighted least squares regression models of age-, sex-, and race-adjusted county mortality rates were estimated to examine the additive and interactive effects of income inequality and minority racial concentration. Results. Higher income inequality at the county level was significantly associated with higher total mortality. Higher minority racial concentration also was significantly related to higher mortality and interacted with income inequality. Conclusions. The relationship between income inequality and mortality is robust for counties in the United States. Minority concentration interacts with income inequality, resulting in higher mortality in counties with low inequality and a high percentage of Blacks than in counties with high inequality and a high percentage of Blacks.

Abstract: Objectives. This study estimated the prevalence of violence during pregnancy in relation to HIV infection. Methods. Violence, current partnerships, and HIV risk behaviors were assessed among 336 HIV-seropositive and 298 HIV-seronegative at-risk pregnant women. Results. Overall, 8.9% of women experienced recent violence; 21.5% currently had abusive partners. Violence was experienced by women in all partnership categories (range = 3.8% with nonabusive partners to 53.6% with physically abusive partners). Neither experiencing violence nor having an abusive partner differed by serostatus. Receiving an HIV diagnosis prenatally did not increase risk. Disclosure-related violence occurred, but was rare. Conclusions. Many HIV-infected pregnant women experience violence, but it is not typically attributable to their serostatus. Prenatal services should incorporate screening and counseling for all women at risk for violence.

Abstract: Objectives. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and correlates of treatment for serious mental illness. Methods. Data were derived from the National Comorbidity Survey, a cross-sectional, nationally representative household survey assessing the presence and correlates of mental disorders and treatments. Crude and adjusted likelihoods of receiving treatment for serious mental illness in the previous 12 months were calculated. Results. Forty percent of respondents with serious mental illness had received treatment in the previous year. Of those receiving treatment, 38.9% received care that could be considered at least minimally adequate, resulting in 15.3% of all respondents with serious mental illness receiving minimally adequate treatment. Predictors of not receiving minimally adequate treatment included being a young adult or an African American, residing in the South, being diagnosed as having a psychotic disorder, and being treated in the general medical sector. Conclusions. Inadequate treatment of serious mental illness is an enormous public health problem. Public policies and cost-effective interventions are needed to improve both access to treatment and quality of treatment.

Abstract: Objectives. Profound and growing disparities exist in oral health among certain US populations. We sought here to determine the prevalence of oral health complaints among Harlem adults by measures of social class, as well as their access to oral health care. Methods. A population-based survey of adults in Central Harlem was conducted from 1992 to 1994. Two questions on oral health were included: whether participants had experienced problems with their teeth or gums during the past 12 months and, if so, whether they had seen a dentist. Results. Of 50 health conditions queried about, problems with teeth or gums were the chief complaint among participants (30%). Those more likely to report oral health problems than other participants had annual household incomes of less than $9000 (36%), were unemployed (34%), and lacked health insurance (34%). The privately insured were almost twice as likely to have seen a dentist for oral health problems (87%) than were the uninsured (48%). Conclusions. There is an urgent need to provide oral health services for adults in Harlem. Integrating oral health into comprehensive primary care is one promising mechanism.

Abstract: Objectives. This study assessed the relationship between incomplete birth certificates and infant mortality. Methods. Birth certificates from California (n = 538 945) were assessed in regard to underreporting of 13 predictors of perinatal outcomes and mortality. Results. Of the birth certificates studied, 7.25% were incomplete. Underreporting was most common in the case of women at high risk for poor perinatal outcomes and infants dying within the first day. Increasing numbers of unreported items were shown to be associated with corresponding increases in neonatal and postneonatal mortality rates. Conclusions. Incomplete birth certificates provide an important marker for identifying high-risk women and vulnerable infants. Because data "cleaning" will result in the removal of mothers and infants at highest risk, birth certificate analyses should include incomplete records.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined longitudinal trends in use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) among a cohort of HIV-positive participants in the Women's Interagency HIV Study. Methods. Beginning in 1994, 1690 HIV-positive women reported detailed information about their use of antiretroviral therapy at 6-month study visits. Multivariate logistic and Cox regression analyses were used to estimate the likelihood of antiretroviral therapy and HAART use among women with study visits preceding and following HAART availability. Results. Before the availability of HAART, the cohort's likelihood of any antiretroviral therapy use was associated with clinical indicators (CD4 count, viral load, symptom presence) as well as behavioral factors (abstaining from drug and alcohol use, participating in clinical trials). After HAART became commercially available, newly emerging predictors included college education, private insurance, absence of injection drug use history, and not being African American. Conclusions. After the penetration of HAART into this cohort, additional differences emerged between HAART users and nonusers. These findings can inform public health efforts to enhance women's access to the most effective types of therapy.

Abstract: Objectives. This study examined changes in tobacco promotions in the alternative press in San Francisco and Philadelphia from 1994 to 1999. Methods. A random sample of alternative newspapers was analyzed, and a content analysis was conducted. Results. Between 1994 and 1999, numbers of tobacco advertisements increased from 8 to 337 in San Francisco and from 8 to 351 in Philadelphia. Product advertisements represented only 45% to 50% of the total; the remaining advertisements were entertainment-focused promotions, mostly bar-club and event promotions. Conclusions. The tobacco industry has increased its use of bars and clubs as promotional venues and has used the alternative press to reach the young adults who frequent these establishments. This increased targeting of young adults may be associated with an increase in smoking among this group.

Abstract: Oral health needs are urgent in rural states. Creative, broad-based, and collaborative solutions can alleviate these needs. "Health commons" sites are enhanced, community-based, primary care safety net practices that include medical, behavioral, social, public, and oral health services. Successful intervention requires a comprehensive approach, including attention to enhancing dental service capacity, broadening the scope of the dental skills of locally available providers, expanding the pool of dental providers, creating new interdisciplinary teams in enhanced community-based sites, and developing more comprehensive oral health policy. By incorporating oral health services into the health commons primary care model, access for uninsured and underserved populations is increased. A coalition of motivated stakeholders includes community leaders, safety net providers, legislators, insurers, and medical, dental, and public health providers.

Abstract: Asthma is now the leading cause of school absence among children of color in impoverished urban neighborhoods. Environmental interventions have the potential to augment clinical approaches to asthma management by directly reducing exposure to environmental triggers (e.g., cockroaches, rodents, and mold). We implemented an apartment-based intervention to reduce exposures to indoor allergens among children living with asthma in 2 areas in New York City with rates of asthma morbidity and mortality that rank among the highest in the United States. Although the intervention phase of the present study is not yet complete, timely reporting of our field experiences may prove useful to other groups engaged in environmental intervention trials in urban communities.

Abstract: Objectives. This report describes the extent of deregionalization of neonatal intensive care in urban areas of the United States in the 1980s and 1990s and the factors associated with it. Methods. We conducted a 15-year retrospective analysis of secondary data from US metropolitan statistical areas. Primary outcome measures are number of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) beds, number of NICU hospitals, and number of small NICUs. Results. Growth in the supply of NICU care has outpaced the need. During the study period (1980-1995), the number of hospitals grew by 99%, the number of NICU beds by 138%, and the number of neonatologists by 268%. In contrast, the growth in needed bed days was only 84%. Of greater concern, the number of beds in small NICU facilities continues to grow. Local regulatory and practice characteristics are important in explaining this growth. Conclusions. Local policymakers should examine the factors that facilitate the proliferation of services, especially the development of small NICUs. Policies that encourage cooperative efforts by hospitals should be developed. Eliminating small NICUs would not restrict the NICU bed supply in most metropolitan statistical areas.

Abstract: Objectives. This study determined the percentage of adverse outcomes in US men attributable to combat exposure. Methods. Standardized psychiatric interviews (modified Diagnostic Interview Schedule and Composite International Diagnostic Interview assessments) were administered to a representative national sample of 2583 men aged 18 to 54 in the National Comorbidity Survey part II subsample. Results. Adjusted attributable fraction estimates indicated that the following were significantly attributable to combat exposure: 27.8% of 12-month posttraumatic stress disorder, 7.4% of 12-month major depressive disorder, 8% of 12-month substance abuse disorder, 11.7% of 12-month job loss, 8.9% of current unemployment, 7.8% of current divorce or separation, and 21% of current spouse or partner abuse. Conclusions. Combat exposure results in substantial morbidity lasting decades and accounts for significant and multifarious forms of dysfunction at the national level.

Title: Problems with access to dental care for medicaid-insured children: What caregivers think

Abstract: Objectives. This study aimed to gain insight into the experiences, attitudes, and perceptions of a racially and ethnically diverse group of caregivers regarding barriers to dental care for their Medicaid-insured children. Methods. Criterion-purposive sampling was used to select participants for 11 focus groups, which were conducted in North Carolina. Seventy-seven caregivers of diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds participated. Full recordings of sessions were obtained and transcribed. A comprehensive content review of all data, including line-by-line analysis, was conducted. Results. Negative experiences with the dental care system discouraged many caregivers in the focus groups from obtaining dental services for their Medicaid-insured children. Searching for providers, arranging an appointment where choices were severely limited, and finding transportation left caregivers describing themselves as discouraged and exhausted. Caregivers who successfully negotiated these barriers felt that they encountered additional barriers in the dental care setting, including long waiting times and judgmental, disrespectful, and discriminatory behavior from staff and providers because of their race and public assistance status. Conclusions. Current proposals to solve the dental access problem probably will be insufficient until barriers identified by caregivers are addressed.
