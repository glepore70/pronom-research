This specification describes version 1 of the Research Documents Information Format (ReDIF). ReDIF version 1 will be referred to as ReDIF throughout. ReDIF is a metadata format to describe the output aspects of academic disciplines. But that we mean the scientific documents that are produced, the channels through which they are made public, the authors who produce the documents and the editors who control the output channels, etc as well as the institutions that support this process. ReDIF does not aim at a very elaborate description of these items. Its overriding design goal is simplicity. It is aimed primarily for the use by academics as a self-documentation tool. The idea is that if academics can make a better documentation of their work themselves, then the need for expensive intermediation between academics is reduced. ReDIF is supposed to be understood and deployed by people with no formal cataloging training.
