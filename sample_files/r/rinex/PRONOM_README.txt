In the field of geodesy, Receiver Independent Exchange Format (RINEX) is a data interchange format for raw satellite navigation system data. This allows the user to post-process the received data to produce a more accurate result â€” usually with other data unknown to the original receiver, such as better models of the atmospheric conditions at time of measurement.
