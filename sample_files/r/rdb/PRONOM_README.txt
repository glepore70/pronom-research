Symantec Resource Studio v1.0 16-32 bit - October 1995 Windows 3.1/Win95 Use to edit/change resources inside 16/32 bit EXE and DLL files, such as cursors, bitmaps: alter or even change the language in Dialog boxes. This is taken from Symantec C++ 7.0 (I think). It's an unpack and run archive - there was not a separate installer. Although not as well known as Borland's Resource Workshop, this one does work well and offers OLE. After all, Symantec had purchased Zortech right about when it was at version 6.1, and Zortech was the DeLorean of its day - back when good compilers were hard (and expensive) to come by. Just unpack to a directory off the root of your hard drive such as C:\RES_EDIT and run. Cheers, AppleSeed in 2016
