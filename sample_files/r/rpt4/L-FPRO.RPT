Virus scanning report  -  26. September 1994   18:54

F-PROT 2.14 created 15. September 1994
Virus search strings created 22. September 1994

Method: Heuristics
Search: Hard disk
Action: Automatic renaming
Targets: Boot/File/User/Packed
Files: All files

Warning: You have selected heuristic scan of all files, including data files.
As heuristic scan is only intended to analyse .COM and .EXE executable files,
this may produce a large number of false positives.  We do NOT recommend
using this combination of scanning options, and we warn that any report of
suspicious code in non-executable files is probably a false alarm.
Scanning MBR of hard disk 1
Scanning MBR of hard disk 2
Scanning boot sector C:
Scanning volume Íƒù
C:\CRIS\Q\ACID.COM  Possibly a new variant of Chill
C:\CRIS\Q\ACID.COM seems to be infected with a virus.
Please contact Frisk Software International to check if this is a known
false alarm or send us a copy for analysis.
C:\ACID\Q'EVIL.COM  Possibly a new variant of Chill
C:\ACID\Q'EVIL.COM seems to be infected with a virus.
Please contact Frisk Software International to check if this is a known
false alarm or send us a copy for analysis.
Scanning boot sector D:
Scanning volume MSDOS_6    
Note: D:\DOS\PKUNLITE.EXE has been inoculated by Central Point Anti-Virus.
D:\DOS\TADD.EXE is an "armored" program.
This means that it uses some "tricks" to make disassembly and analysis
difficult.  Many games and utilities employ this type of protection,
but it is also used by some viruses to make heuristic analysis difficult.
