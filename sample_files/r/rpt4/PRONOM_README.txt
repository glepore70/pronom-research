History
The company was founded in 1993.[1] Its name is derived from the initial letters of the personal name and patronymic of Friðrik Skúlason, its founder.[2] Dr. Vesselin Vladimirov Bontchev, a computer expert from Bulgaria, best known for his research on the Dark Avenger virus, worked for the company as an anti-virus researcher.[3]

F-Prot Antivirus was first released in 1989, making it one of the longest lived anti-virus brands on the market.[4] It was the world's first with a heuristic engine.[2] It is sold in both home and corporate packages, of which there are editions for Windows and Linux. There are corporate versions for Microsoft Exchange, Solaris, and certain IBM eServers.[5][6] The Linux version is available to home users free of charge, with virus definition updates. Free 30-day trial versions for other platforms can be downloaded. F-Prot AVES is specifically targeted towards corporate users.[7]
