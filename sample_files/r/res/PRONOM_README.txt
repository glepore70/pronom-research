Microsoft Resource Files (C++)


Since projects in .NET programming languages do not use resource script files, you must open your resources from Solution Explorer. Use the Image editor and the Binary editor to work with resource files in managed projects.

Any managed resources you want to edit must be linked resources. The Visual Studio resource editors do not support editing embedded resources.

The term resource file can refer to a number of file types, like:

The resource script (.rc) file of a program.

A resource template (.rct) file.

An individual resource existing as a stand-alone file. This type includes a bitmap, icon, or cursor file that's referred to from an .rc file.

A header file generated by the development environment. This type includes Resource.h, that's referred to from an .rc file.

Resources found in other file types such as .exe, .dll, and .res files are referred to as resources.
