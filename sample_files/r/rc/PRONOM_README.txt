Contains resources that will not be edited by Visual C++ but will be included in the final compiled .EXE file. AppWizard creates no such resources by default, since Visual C++ can edit all of the standard resources, including the version resource (a new feature in this release). An empty file is generated by AppWizard in case you wish to add your own custom formatted resources to this file.
