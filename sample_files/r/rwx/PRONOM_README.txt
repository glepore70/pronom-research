A RenderWare object (RWX file) is a 3D object stored in a format used by some versions of the RenderWare game engine software. This format is actually in the form of a scripting or programming language in that it has sequentially-executed commands that are used to define the object.

A RWX file is an ASCII text file that is editable in any text editor. It was used only in the 2.x versions of RenderWare; later versions dropped support for the format.
