RMF is a simple tiled raster format used in the GIS “Integration” and “Panorama” GIS. The format itself has very poor capabilities.

There are two flavors of RMF called MTW and RSW. MTW supports 16-bit integer and 32/64-bit floating point data in a single channel and aimed to store DEM data. RSW is a general purpose raster. It supports single channel colormapped or three channel RGB images. Only 8-bit data can be stored in RSW. Simple georeferencing can be provided for both image types.
